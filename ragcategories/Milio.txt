Milio is a warmhearted boy from Ixtal who has, despite his young age, mastered the fire axiom and discovered something new: soothing fire. With this newfound power, Milio plans to help his family escape their exile by joining the Yun Tal—just like his grandmother once did. Having traveled through the Ixtal jungles to the capital of Ixaocan, Milio now prepares to face the Vidalion and join the Yun Tal, unaware of the trials—and dangers—that await him.

An archmagus of the court wreathed in firefly familiars, Milio knows just about everything that happens within the palace walls. He may seem like a child, but fae are long-lived, and Milio has been a child far longer than others have been adults. Still, he is a friendly face who uses his power to safeguard the Queendom however he can.

Milio always loved water, and growing up with his frog family of lyrical croakers meant there was never any shortage of rain. But once they lost their ability to sing and the lands dried up, he took on new responsibilities. Gathering up his family in his backpack, he set out to restore their singing voices and learn their songs as a new Rain Shepherd.

Enchanter
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Enchanters
focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.
Examples

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.

attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends
. Each champion possesses unique abilities and
attributes
.
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Enchantment redirection
A certain group of damaging abilities called
enchantments
or
empowerments
require interaction of an
empowerer
, with an
ally
hitting an enemy. Enchantments commonly include mark detonations or
buffs
given to allies. The credit for an applied enchantment is directed in the following ways:
Any damage dealt through the ally by the enchantment is credited to the empowerer instead of the ally. Effects that can trigger on-damage instances of the empowerer (e.g.
Summon Aery
;
Morellonomicon's
Grievous Wounds
on magic damage; etc.) will trigger and also be credited to the empowerer. For the empowerer's redirected damage only, the ally will apply the empowerer's damage modifiers (e.g.
magic penetration
).
Any unit
kill
achieved by the ally having applied the empowerer's redirected damage, is credited to the ally instead of the empowerer.

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet

Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Targeting forgiveness
Certain unit-targeted abilities present an accuracy-grace system called
targeting forgiveness
.
When no valid target is
directly selected
upon using the ability, it will automatically search for one within a certain
center-to-center
forgiveness radius
. If a valid target is found within the forgiveness radius, the ability will automatically acquire them and cast on them. If multiple targets are found, the nearest one to the forgiveness radius' center is chosen.
Only ally-targeted abilities may utilize this system. Not to be confused with a different, priority-based system that a few other spells (e.g.
Smite
) use.
League of Legends content
Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery

Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.
"
Cleanse
" does not always refer to the act of removing
all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.

Crowd control
A unit that is
disabled
is affected by a status effect that prevents certain actions – such as movement, attacking, casting and/or seeing–blocked, reduced or controlled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed

Tenacity
Tenacity
(or
Crowd Control Reduction
) is a stat that reduces the duration of all incoming
crowd control
effects except
displacements
,
drowsy
,
nearsight
,
stasis
, and
suppression
.

If
tenacity
is reduced below 0, the crowd control duration increases.
Tenacity
stacks
multiplicatively
or
additively
based on the combination of effects.
The duration of a crowd control debuff is calculated when it is applied, and
tenacity
can reduce it to a minimum 0.
5
seconds.

Cast-inhibiting crowd control
A unit that is affected by
cast-inhibiting crowd control
is unable to cast abilities, activate items, or use summoner spells. The following crowd control effects disable casting of all spells and abilities as well as interrupts all
channels
:
Airborne
Forced Action

Note that
Disrupt
is not a status effect and solely interrupts channels, and thus cannot fall under this classification.
Root
and
Ground
only disable movement spells and abilities.
Stasis
and
Suppression
are the only crowd control effects that disable all summoner spells from use; all other cast-inhibiting crowd control only disable movement summoner spells.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
