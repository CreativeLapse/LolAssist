and deal the

over 6 strikes in 0.

Samira
will

resets
Samira's

The stack count is represented by the grades
to the left of
Samira's
health bar
, visible to the player only, as well as a stack counter under the
health bar
, visible to all players.
The empowered attack can trigger on
immobilizes
from both ally and enemy sources.
Those applied by the
neutral
team (e.g.
Dragon's
initial knock back)
can
be targeted.
It cannot trigger against enemies knocked
airborne
by a
Blast Cone
triggered by anyone.
(note)
The empowered attack's interaction with
immunities to crowd control
:
It
will not
trigger against
crowd control immune
and
displacement immune
targets.
The knock up will be resisted by
Riposte
, but the ability does not trigger its on-
immobilization
effect.
(note)
The empowered attack will not apply the knock up against
suspended
enemies.
The empowered attack will only apply the knock up if the target is still
immobilized
or
airborne
upon being hit. It will not apply if they are no longer disabled when hit.
The empowered attack cannot be used against a target with a
spell shield
.
The application of the knock up can occur on any of the missiles of the empowered attack if it had not already occurred on the first missile.
A missile that is parried by
Riposte
or is
dodged
,
blocked
, or missed while
Samira
is
blinded
cannot
apply the knock up.
While
grounded
or
rooted
,
Samira
cannot
dash
into range to use the empowered attack. She can only use it if her target is within her
attack range
while under this condition.
The on-target cooldown will apply even if the empowered attack is parried.
The empowered attack rolls
critical strike
for each shot of the flurry.
The
bonus
magic damage
dealt with the blade is
default damage
. The empowered attack is first 1 instance of
basic damage
and then 5 instances of
default damage
.
The attacks do not deal the
bonus
damage against
structures
.
The empowered attack is unaffected by
attack speed
modifiers.
Guinsoo's Rageblade's
Phantom Hit
and
Runaan's Hurricane's
bolts will not apply the
bonus
magic damage
, since it is a hit effect of specifically the melee attack casts.
Attacks with the gun and blade do not count as different attacks for stacking
Style
.
Basic attacks using the blade are still classified as
ranged
.
The melee attack's range condition is unaffected by
attack range
modifiers (e.g.
Rapid Firecannon
).
Blade range is calculated edge-to-edge just like basic attack ranges are, hence both
Samira
gaining bonus
size
or her target increases the total distance at which
Samira
can attack them with the blade.
Since the
knock up
requires an exterior source to
immobilize
the enemy,
Aftershock
will be swapped with
Grasp of the Undying
for
Samira
at the start of the game.
Abilities blocked by
spell shields
will still grant
Samira

Samira
still gains

Samira stares death in the eye with unyielding confidence, seeking thrill wherever she goes. After her Shuriman home was destroyed as a child, Samira found her true calling in Noxus, where she built a reputation as a stylish daredevil taking on dangerous missions of the highest caliber. Wielding black-powder pistols and a custom-engineered blade, Samira thrives in life-or-death circumstances, eliminating any who stand in her way with flash and flair.

refreshing
on damaging attacks and abilities against enemy champions. The stack count is represented by the grades
to the left of her health bar for

over 6 rapid attacks and
knock up
the target for 0.

reset
and the attack to become
unstoppable

Samira
will
dash
into it from up to
800 / 850 / 900 / 950 / 1000 (based on level)
units and then attack. This effect cannot occur on the same target more than once every
10 seconds

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Samira was accidentally pushed to
PBE
prior to the supposed reveal.
Samira
is one of 21 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Aatrox
,
Camille
,
Darius
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
K'Sante
,
Kayn
,
Kled
,
Naafiri
,
Nilah
,
Olaf
,
Pyke
,
Riven
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Urgot
,
Xayah
,
Yone
, and
Zed
.
Unlike conventional
emotes
, Samira's
Taunt
has mechanical functions. It creates a coin skillshot that, if Samira has
1
to spare, deals 1 damage and gives
1
to enemy champions.
[2]
It also automatically aims towards dead enemy champions in range.
[3]
Samira
comes from either Sanskrit
Sam
īra
समीर "wind, breeze, air"
[4]
or Arabic سميرة
Sāmira
"night-companion, nighttalker", feminine active participle of سَمَرَ
samara
"to spend the night".
[5]
Samira's movement animations change form depending on whether her recent attack used the gun or blade.
The blocking animation of
Blade Whirl
has Samira explicitly shoot every single incoming projectile.
[6]
Samira was teased ingame with the
Style: Rank S
loot item earnable in patch
V10.17
. It was
awarded
by scoring a takedown after fighting in a manner like
Daredevil Impulse
.
If players look at the
Daredevil Impulse
stacks in the slot, it will show "Why are you looking? Go style on your enemies!"

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Immobilize
Immobilized
units cannot control their movement. The following crowd control effects

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells

Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

Cc-Immune
Crowd control immunity
prevents
any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic

Suspension
A unit that is
suspended
is
stunned
for the duration. It also pretends to be
airborne

,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
for the duration.
Suspension
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Unlike common
stuns
,
suspension
is prevented by effects that prevent
displacements
and becoming
suspended
also interrupts the ongoing movement of
dashes
and
airborne
effects.

Like common
stuns
, it is affected by
Tenacity
and can be fully removed by
cleansing
effects.

(excluding
uncancellable windups
) and all
channeled and charged
abilities and all
dashes

status effects).
Knock ups
will not have their
airborne
status removed if there is no sourced debuff, but their forced movement still ends.

The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases

reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters

champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes

blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to

basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
