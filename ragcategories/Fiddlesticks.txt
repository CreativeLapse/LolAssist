A Harmless Scarecrow
EFFECT RADIUS:
900
Innate:
Fiddlesticks
has a
Scarecrow Effigy
in place of a trinket, which will imitate
Fiddlesticks
.
Fiddlesticks
can impersonate an effigy by remaining idle
out of combat
. After level 6, placing an effigy will
reveal
the area for a few seconds.
Innate - Scarecrow Effigy:
Fiddlesticks
begins the game with an exclusive
Scarecrow Effigy
, which permanently occupies the
trinket
slot.
Fiddlesticks
can pretend to be an
Effigy
by standing still and not acting nor being acted upon for 2 seconds, during which it adjusts its body into a scarecrow and extends its arm out to expose its lantern.
Innate - A Harmless Scarecrow:
From
level
6 onward, placing an
Effigy
also summons a
Sweeper Drone
at the location for 6 seconds.

The fear-immunity timer is not refreshed by subsequent attempts to fear the target.
The
fear
is applied
at the end of the cast time
, regardless of the target's distance.
The missile cannot be destroyed except by
projectile-interception
effects.
Fiddlesticks
is considered "seen" if it is visible and is inside an enemy champion's
sight radius
. Vision from
minions
,
wards
, and
turrets
will not prevent
Fiddlesticks
from
fearing
if there are no nearby enemy champions.
There is a very brief grace period after being seen or when entering combat. This can allow for multiple spells to inflict
fear
.
Monsters
are feared by
Fiddlesticks's
abilities when
Fiddlesticks
is out of combat, with some exceptions.
If
Fiddlesticks
has recently damaged a monster from a camp with a basic attack or abilities (including
Smite
but not item active abilities), monsters in that camp will not be feared by his other abilities.
Bountiful Harvest
will not fear monsters unless
Fiddlesticks
is pretending to be an
Effigy
or is not visible to them.
Minions
are always feared if
Fiddlesticks
is not attacking them and there is no enemy champion in its view.
The passive portion does not currently communicate any information to
Fiddlesticks
, its allies nor its enemies. There is no indicator to say that
Fiddlesticks
is out of combat; and no indicator or debuff icon on affected enemies.
A visual indicator will circle around all enemy champions while
Fiddlesticks
is channeling
Crowstorm
if it is unseen. This is only visible to
Fiddlesticks
.
The fear immunity applies even if the target is
crowd control immune
. It is not applied if it is blocked by
spell shield
.
Terrify
will still cast and affect the target even if
Fiddlesticks
dies or loses
sight
of them during the cast time.
Terrify
will still cast but not affect the target if they die or become
untargetable
during the cast time. There is no compensation.
The
player's
screen will have a visual effect when successfully
feared
by
Terrify
.
-
Surprise Party Fiddlesticks
has a special icon for this ability.
Crowstorm
will not fear enemy champions if cast while they have vision of
Fiddlesticks
, even if
Fiddlesticks
is pretending to be an
Effigy
.
Tips & Tricks
Nearsight
reduces an enemy
champion's
sight
radius, thus allowing
Fiddlesticks
to utilize the passive portion of
Terrify
more effectively.

Something has awoken in Runeterra. Something ancient. Something terrible. The ageless horror known as Fiddlesticks stalks the edges of mortal society, drawn to areas thick with paranoia where it feeds upon terrorized victims. Wielding a jagged scythe, the haggard, makeshift creature reaps fear itself, shattering the minds of those unlucky enough to survive in its wake. Beware the sounding of the crow, or the whispering of the shape that appears almost human… Fiddlesticks has returned.

A gruesome spectre, rumored to stand eternally watchful over a peculiar book of fables. Brave knights and cruel sorceresses alike have tried in vain to reach the tome, but none have ever returned. Perhaps that lost queendom of old isn't so fictional after all…

Once upon a time in a faraway land, a jealous young emperor invoked profane summoning rites in exchange for power. Yet when the ancient horror Fiddlesticks stepped forth, it did not aid the boy--and in an instant, his empire was utterly destroyed. The fiend was trapped beneath the ruins… until now.

The Remembrancers' worst fears have been realized. Emerging from tears in the fabric of spacetime, hordes of faceless, robotic marauders appear across the multiverse, destroying everything in their path. Fiddlesticks is only a single unit in this endless invasion force, assimilating any technology it comes across, and eradicating all life.

The creature known as Fiddlesticks has fed on Star Guardians across every era, hunting those on the verge of falling before finally consuming their light. Its connection to the Guardians, and the reason it is drawn to them, is not well understood... but the familiar seemingly trapped within it suggests a truly disturbing origin.

A demon of fear and chaos, Fiddlesticks was summoned directly into the mortal realm by Aatrox himself. It craves violence and the taste of blood, driven purely by instinct and compulsion as it tears through Ionia. Other demons follow in its wake, scavenging what remains of its carnage.

starts each game with an exclusive
Scarecrow Effigy

Scarecrow Effigy
: Consume a charge to place a visible
Effigy
at the target location (X range), which reveals the surrounding area. The effigy visually appears exactly as
Fiddlesticks
does to enemies. Enemy
champions
that approach an effigy will activate it, causing the effigy to fake a random action, after which the effigy will deal 1 damage to itself. Stores one charge every
115 − 30 (based on level)
seconds, up to 2 maximum charges.

Fiddlesticks, the Harbinger of Doom

by
L. Frank Baum

A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
He appears to be left-handed.
His

made a
cameo
in
Fright Night
along with
Chinese Classic Karthus
.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called
"8-bit-tlesticks"
, referencing the
8-bit era
of video games.
The following changes were also jokingly listed:
Crowstorm
now triggers
Terrify
on all enemies caught in the area of effect.
Notably, this mechanic was actually implemented in post-
rework
Fiddlesticks's kit due to
Terrify's
new passive.
Terrify
: fear duration has been increased to 10 seconds at all ranks.
Fiddlesticks has been removed from the League.
His pre-
rework
W ability,
Drain
, had its name reused by
Vladimir
for his ability in
Teamfight Tactics
Set 2.

Specialist
Specialists
are champions that do not fit into the "neat little boxes" of the other classes, and represent Riot's ideal of having a champion roster with a lot of distinctiveness and diversity.
Examples
Azir
Teemo
Heimerdinger
Singed
Gangplank
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

acquisition range

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following

Crowd control
A unit that is
disabled
is affected by a status effect that prevents certain actions – such as movement, attacking, casting and/or seeing–blocked, reduced or controlled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted

The crowd control effect may still be

Clone
A
clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet

, copying their current vitality, stats, items, level, and most status effects upon creation. They are considered champions against many effects that do not strictly require
player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.

damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a

Centered range

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.

units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or

Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Cc-Immune
Crowd control immunity
prevents
any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic
monsters
(excluding a summoned
Rift Herald
) and
turrets
are always immune to all crowd control, with the exception of
stasis
.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Nearsight
A unit that is
nearsighted
has their
sight
radius reduced and
cannot
see beyond their sight radius.
While nearsighted, units cannot reveal
stealthed
wards
or
traps
. Nearsighted units lose vision of all their allies as well as all external sources of vision (including from wards or abilities). This prevents
unit-targeted
effects, including
basic attacks
, from being used outside of the unit's reduced sight radius.
True sight
and
unobstructed vision
do
not
bypass the vision blocked by
nearsight
.
Sources of
nearsight
do
not
stack with each other; only the application with the greatest sight reduction will take effect.
Interrupts:
Interrupts target commands if the
nearsighted
unit's target is outside of their new vision area and prevents
automated target acquisition
.
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
with the exceptions of
Fiora's
Riposte
and
Morgana's
Black Shield
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
with the exceptions of
Yone's
Soul Unbound
(recast),
Cleanse
, and
Mikael's Blessing
.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

champions
on each team are the same.

All champions receive the
One for All buff
, which grants 70
summoner spell haste
and
40
bonus
movement speed

Karthus
and
Teemo
are disabled in this mode.
