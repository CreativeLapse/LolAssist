Assassin's Mark
EFFECT RADIUS:
500
Innate:
Akali's
damage with abilities against a champion create a ring around them for a few seconds, and she gains
move speed
while moving away from the ring. Once
Akali
exits the ring, she regains the
move speed
towards enemy champions and empowers her next
basic attack
with
bonus
range
and
magic damage
.
Innate:
When
Akali
damages an enemy
champion
with an
ability
, she creates a ring around them for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent damaging abilities against champions. For 2 seconds, she gains
30 / 40 / 50 / 60% (based on level)
bonus
movement speed
while moving away from the center of the ring. Only one ring may be active at a time.
When
Akali
exits the ring, for 2 seconds, she regains the
bonus
movement speed
while facing nearby enemy champions and becomes empowered with
Swinging Kama
for 4 seconds, during which she cannot create another ring.
Swinging Kama:
Akali's
next
basic attack
is empowered to have its
range
doubled and deal

Enemies cannot see the ring, but can see the empower effect.
Swinging Kama
gives a static
bonus
range which doesn't change if
Akali's
range changes during it (i.e
Rapid Firecannon
):
If
Rapid Firecannon
fully charges within
Swinging Kama's
duration,
Akali's
total range increases to
337.5
.
If
Rapid Firecannon
fully charges before gaining
Swinging Kama
,
Akali's
total range is increased to
395
.
The ring will be created around the last target hit by
Five Point Strike
.
The ring's center is offset 120 units away from the enemy's center, towards Akali.
The empowered attack can be
dodged
and
blocked
, and will be mitigated by
blinds
.
The empowered attack will trigger but not be consumed nor apply its effects against
structures
and

Akali
will track the target if they change locations.
She will not stop tracking the target until she reaches them, as there is no maximum tracking distance.
Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Shuriken Flip
does not interrupt
Akali's
previous move or attack orders.
The recast does.
Shuriken Flip
cannot be recast if the target is not
visible
or is
untargetable
.
Akali
will be ordered to basic attack the target after the recast's dash ends.
Akali
will dash backwards up-to 400 units in a straight line. This dash can cross terrain if the end point is beyond it. If she would end the dash inside terrain, she will instead look for a location  in either direction left or right that is outside of terrain and dash there. If there is no such location, she will dash only up to the wall at her normal speed, ending the dash early.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
The shuriken missile will fire from wherever
Akali
is at the end of the cast time (usually mid-dash), but always towards and reaching the location that was 825 units in front of her at the start of cast. The only exception is if she moves via
Flash
, in which case the range of the missile is decreased relative to the distance she blinked.
Killing an enemy with the shuriken will still mark the last area of the
shroud
hit.
Attempting to cast
Five Point Strike
during either dash will buffer it to cast as soon as the dash ends.

Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.

Arriving clad in a bold and sporty body suit, Akali's gala attire has us all spellbound. Subversive and on the cutting edge of fashion, she's fierce and redefines how we think of the wicked witch of the woods.

Before her realm's destruction, Akali was rotting away in prison for a failed assassination attempt on a despotic warlord. Now on her own as an Empyrean, she views her newfound freedom as a sign to stop the evil she couldn't before. The realms need a defender, and Akali is determined to fight for them as long as she can.

Akali, the Fist of Shadow
Akali's dance referenced
Single Ladies
by
Beyoncé
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Akali was the only energy-based champion to have any associated cost on their
ultimate
(one Essence of Shadow).
Shadow Dance
was going to be a skillshot but became single-targeted instead.
Akali used to gain the
'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength'
cosmetic
Easter egg
debuff (
"This unit is a flippin' ninja!"
-
"Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health."
) when she,
Kennen
,
Shen
, and/or
Zed
found themselves on the same team. It was removed in
V3.14
for unknown reasons.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, the following change regarding Akali was jokingly listed：
Akali is no longer a ninja.
Akali, the Rogue Assassin
Due to
Japanese rhotacism
,
Akali
may sound identical to Japanese 明かり
akari
"
light
, brightness, gleam", from Old Japanese stative verbal root
*aka(-r-)
"to be red, to be bright" (>
aka(-i)
赤(い) "red")
Akali is the second champion, after
Yasuo
, to have an emote that will orient itself the same (facing towards the camera), no matter what direction Akali was facing.
However, she is the first to always reposition herself to face the camera when using the emotes, and has this function on both her dance and joke emotes.
Akali's Series 1
Eternals
make the following references:
Check Marks
references the
eponymous symbol
.
Like a Ninja
describes
Shuriken Flip's
mobility and use of
shuriken
, two features common in depictions of
ninja
in popular culture.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Energy
Energy
is a resource designed to limit how much a champion is able to use their
basic
abilities during a set time frame rather than through the use of
mana
. It is represented by a
yellow
bar instead of
blue
.
Energy
has a maximum of
200
(except for
Shen
, with
400
), and regenerates rapidly, at a rate of
10 energy
per second. This means that energy champions are not at risk of depleting their resource over a long period of time, however the small capacity restricts the rapid usage of multiple spells.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble

Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.

Edge range
Edge range

Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Sight
is a property of
units

that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range

Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush

Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control

sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting

sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
