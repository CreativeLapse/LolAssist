Projectile
Blocked
Rocket Grab's
range is composed of a missile with 1080 range, and a smaller center-range area check at the end (colloqially known as a 'lollipop').
The area check is currently half as long as it is supposed to be, reducing the intended 1150 range of the ability to 1115 range.
Hitting an enemy with this area check only also fails to play the ability's hit SFX. This makes it possible to easily distinguish whether the target was picked up by the missile collision or 'lollipop'.
Targets
larger than 95 units in radius
can be hit by a different edge-range circle check at the end of the missile.
The
airborne
debuff lasts for up-to 1 second but will end prematurely when the target's movement stops, while the stun will persist (if duration permits).
Displacement immunity
will not resist the application of the
stun
.
The target's destination lies 75 units in front of
Blitzcrank
.
If the target is closer than this, the effect will still move them to this location.
If this location would be inside static terrain, the target's destination will end up on
Blitzcrank's
side, even if that means pulling them right on top of
Blitzcrank
.
This can occasionally fail.
If
Blitzcrank
is being moved (e.g.
Airborne
,
Kinematics
or
Fate's Call
) during the grab, the target will be pulled towards
Blitzcrank
s old location.
Blitzcrank
will be ordered to
basic attack
the target once the target arrives.
If the target dies to
Rocket Grab's
damage, they will not be pulled.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Blitzcrank is an enormous, near-indestructible automaton from Zaun, originally built to dispose of hazardous waste. However, he found this primary purpose too restricting, and modified his own form to better serve the fragile people of the Sump. Blitzcrank selflessly uses his strength and durability to protect others, extending a helpful metal fist or burst of energy to subdue any troublemakers.

Blitz and Crank are Cat Planet's fiercest warriors, and work together seamlessly (mostly) to pilot their mech, Blitzcrank. While Crank believes that he can overcome his lack of rhythm with the help of his exuberant copilot, Blitz is… well… he's busy dancing to his own beat. Together they plan to take over Dog Planet and claim its sunbeams for themselves.

Originally a bomb defusal robot, Blitzcrank was made a referee because of their ability to make split-second adjustments to stay ahead of the prodigious athletes.

Catcher
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Catchers
specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.
Examples
Blitzcrank
Morgana
Zyra
League of Legends content
Tank (Legacy)
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
League of Legends content
Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
. Shield reduction effects, exclusively
Serpent's Fang
, reduce all incoming and outgoing
shields

Arena
is a team deathmatch game mode organized in a tournament format that consists of eight teams of two players fighting on five different battlefields. Teams brawl in rotating combat rounds while powering themselves up with unique Augments and Items and using multiple environmental features to their advantage, in a display of both deeply tactical and highly explosive combat until the last team standing.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of

Kinematics
A unit that is under the effect of
kinematics
will be continually dragged to a specific unit or location until they reach it.
Kinematics
has no effect on units that are performing any form of movement other than basic movement and other
kinematic
effects.
Kinematics
should not be confused as an
airborne
effect nor displacement effect. It does not disable any of the unit's actions.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent the unit from effectively
pathing
to their intended location through basic movement.
Reduction:
The effect is instantaneous.
There is nothing to reduce.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
and
displacement immunity
.
Removal:
Removed by leaving the source of the area of effect. The effect is instantaneous.
There is nothing to cleanse.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

dash
to reappear at the target location. If they collide with an enemy
champion
, they
knock up
all nearby enemies.

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects. Entering
resurrection
does not cancel cast times.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
The
strength
is reduced by
slow resist
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity

Yone's
Soul Unbound

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Slow resist
Slow resist
is a stat that directly reduces the effectiveness of
slows
.
League of Legends content
Tenacity
Tenacity
(or
Crowd Control Reduction
) is a stat that reduces the duration of all incoming
crowd control
effects except
displacements
,
drowsy
,
nearsight
,
stasis
, and
suppression
.
If
tenacity
is reduced below 0, the crowd control duration increases.
Tenacity
stacks
multiplicatively
or
additively
based on the combination of effects.
The duration of a crowd control debuff is calculated when it is applied, and
tenacity
can reduce it to a minimum 0.
5
seconds.
League of Legends content
Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets
.

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil
.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
with the exception of
Mikael's Blessing
.
League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind
and
dodge
take precedence over
block
.
Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet
,
Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.
See the article for more details.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
