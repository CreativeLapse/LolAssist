Active:
Elise
sends a
Volatile Spiderling
to the target location that explodes when it hits an enemy or times out.  If the
Spiderling
does not hit an enemy before then, it will chase down a nearby enemy.
Active:
Elise
summons a venom-gorged spider for 3 seconds, which is
untargetable
and crawls to the target location, navigating its path upon encountering terrain.
The spider explodes upon contact with an enemy or at the end of its lifespan, dealing
magic damage
to nearby enemies.
Magic Damage:
60 / 105 / 150 / 195 / 240
(+ 95% AP)
If the spider does not hit an enemy before reaching the target location, it chases down a nearby enemy, prioritizing
champions
and gaining
bonus
movement speed
based on its proximity to the target.

If
Volatile Spiderling
dashes to a target due to
Venomous Bite
, it will not expire before finishing its jump.
It can still collide with enemies while dashing, but since this proximity check is repeated only every so often, it might phase through an enemy on its way without detecting the collision if dashing quickly enough.
The spiderling checks for nearby targets every
0.
264
seconds
, both for potential enemies to chase down and to explode 'on-contact'. Because of this, it may walk closer to an enemy than its "collision radius" before exploding.

CAST TIME:
none
TARGET RANGE:
825
/

Active:
Elise
and her
Spiderlings
vanish
into the air for a short time.
Rappel
can be recast on a target enemy within the duration, and does so automatically after the duration without a target.
Recast:
Elise
and her
Spiderlings
descend
upon the target enemy, or their current position if there is no target. If
Rappel
is cast directly on a target enemy, she will automatically recast upon the target and
Spider Queen's
effects are increased for a few seconds.
Active:
Elise
and her
Spiderlings
lift up into the air over 0.
6
seconds, immediately becoming
untargetable
and
unable to act
, and afterwards
vanishing
for up to
1.
95
seconds
and granting
sight
of the surrounding
900 units
for the duration.
Rappel
can be recast instantly on a target enemy within the duration, or without a target after
a delay
for the duration, and does the latter automatically after the duration.
Recast:
Elise
and her
Spiderlings
reappear and descend onto the ground over 0.
4
seconds, becoming targetable and able to act again afterwards. Additionally,
Spider Queen's
bonuses are increased for 5 seconds.
Spider Effects Increase:
40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100%
If the recast was used on a target enemy,
Elise
and her
Spiderlings
descend
behind the target's location. Otherwise, she and her
Spiderlings
will descend onto their current position without a target.
Rappel's recast can be used while affected by
cast-inhibiting crowd control

When
Elise
casts
Rappel
, a circle outlines the area in which a target can be selected to descend upon.
Elise
will always attempt to position behind her target at the same offset if she descends within than
Rappel's
max range (825), provided there is enough space at the other side. If the target is at the edge of the recast's radius,
Elise
will not appear at the exact offset behind her target but as close to them as possible instead.
For example, if the target's edge is barely within range for the recast, she will appear in front of them.
If
Elise's
location-targeted recast is used by issuing a movement command within the respective range of
Rappel
, she will descend as normal but then move to the location that the movement command was issued; her movement commands will not be interrupted from descending.
The delay for recasting without a target after
Elise
has lifted into the air is inconsistent.
(bug)
The recast has a 0.
33
-seconds delay for issued movement commands, and a 0.
5
-second delay if the recast input itself is used.
While
Elise
is lifting up into the air, she can buffer
Rappel's
recast by targeting an enemy with an attack command or the recast input itself in the meantime. She however cannot buffer
Rappel's
location-targeted recast.
The initial cast can also directly target an enemy to buffer the recast.
Elise
will lift up into the air 0.
05
seconds shorter in this case.
The bonuses granted for descending are not lost if
Elise
switches to
Human Form
.
Rappel
can be cast on any targetable enemy unit (
champions
,
minions
,
monsters
,
wards
,
traps
, and
jungle plants
)
except
structures
.
If
Elise
is positioned within the radius of the unit she's using the initial target cast on,
Rappel
will instead register as a self-cast and not immediately descend.
(bug)
Elise
can
Rappel
to
Rift Herald
from the other side of the
Baron Nashor's
pit as well as to
Dragon
by standing near the
Scryer's Bloom
spawn locations. This is a result of
sight
being granted in a smaller circle than the target range limit for descending and the
Summoner's Rift
map having height variations.
If
Elise
enters
resurrection
during
Rappel
, she will descend back down immediately.

Elise is a deadly predator who dwells in a shuttered, lightless palace, deep within the oldest city of Noxus. Once mortal, she was the mistress of a powerful house, but the bite of a vile demigod transformed her into something beautiful, yet utterly inhuman—a spider-like creature, drawing unsuspecting prey into her web. To maintain her eternal youth, Elise now prefers to feed upon the naive and the faithless, and there are few who can resist her seductions.

They came to Elise long ago, crawling through the underbrush, their many eyes locked with hers as a deal was made. The unfathomable powers of an Old God for her devotion and humanity. Reborn in the image of an arachnoid deity, Elise lingers along the edges of the Elderwood, enticing to their doom all those foolish enough to believe her a mere folktale.

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind
and
dodge
take precedence over
block
.
Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block

blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Ward
Wards
are deployable units that that grant

There are three kinds of deployable
wards
available for purchase:
Control Ward

Zombie Ward
, are usable through various means.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
