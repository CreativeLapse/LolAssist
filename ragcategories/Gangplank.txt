Trial by Fire
STATIC COOLDOWN
:

Innate:
Every few seconds, Gangplank's next basic attack will burn the target, continually dealing
bonus
true damage
and granting him

. Whenever a
Powder Keg
explodes,
Trial by Fire's
cooldown will
reset
and
Gangplank
will gain the
movement speed
.
Innate:
Periodically,
Gangplank
empowers his next
basic attack
to set the target on fire, dealing them
「

If
Gangplank
successfully hits a target with

bonus
movement speed
for 2 seconds. Every time a
Powder Keg
explodes, the
cooldown
for
Trial by Fire
resets and
Gangplank
gains its
bonus
movement speed

Even spell effects such as

will work with this when triggered by
Parrrley
as their

. Spell effects that do not belong to their triggering cast instance, such as
Liandry's Torment's
damage debuff, do not grant plunder for enemies they kill.
If the target becomes

Active:
Gangplank
places a
Powder Keg
at the target location, which can be basic attacked or
shot
to damage it. If an enemy destroys a
Powder Keg
, it is safely dismantled. If
Gangplank
destroys a
Powder Keg
, it will explode to deal the
attack's damage
to nearby enemies and
slow
them. Against an enemy
champion
, the explosion additionally deals
bonus
physical damage
and ignores a
portion of their armor
.
The explosion will cause nearby
Powder Kegs
to also explode.
Gangplank
stocks a
Powder Keg
every few seconds, up to a maximum.
Active:
Gangplank
consumes a charge to place a powder keg at the target location that lasts for 25 seconds and will connect to other kegs with overlapping connection radius through a trail of black powder. The keg starts with
3 health
and loses
1
every
2 / 1 / 0.
5
(based on level)
seconds until it is left with
1 health
.
Gangplank
periodically
stocks
a
Powder Keg
charge, up to a maximum.
Maximum charges:
3 / 3 / 4 / 4 / 5
Kegs can be
basic attacked
by enemies or
Gangplank
(including his
Parrrley
), dealing 1 damage to it. When an enemy destroys it, it is safely defused. When
Gangplank
destroys it, it explodes and also triggers a chain reaction that explodes other nearby connected kegs with a
0.
33
seconds
-delay between explosions. The explosions also grant
sight
of their radiuses for 2 seconds.
Enemies caught in an explosion are
slowed
for 2 seconds, and are dealt the triggering
attack's damage
, dealing
bonus
physical damage
against
champions
. Each enemy can only be hit once per chain and the damage dealt ignores
40% of the target's armor
.
Slow:
40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80%
Bonus Champion Damage:
75 / 105 / 135 / 165 / 195
If the triggering attack was a
critical strike
, the explosions deal 5% more damage on top of the critical damage.

The triggering attack's damage can include
Parrrley
's base damage and
Spellblade
.
When triggered with critical strike,
Spellblade
and the bonus damage to champions are added after the calculations, meaning that these effects are not increased by 5%.
The total damage can be calculated with this formula:
{aDMG * [1.75 (
+ 0.40
)] * 1.05} + sDMG + cDMG
Where:
aDMG = Triggering attack's damage
sDMG = Spellblade's damage
cDMG = Bonus damage to champions
Kegs have special interactions with
Spellblade
:
If the keg destroying attack was empowered with
Spellblade
, its damage will be added to the explosions' damage.
If the keg was not destroyed, it will consume the effect and the keg will store the damage it would have dealt. If the storing keg is the initial detonation of the chain, it will add its damage to the explosions' damage as if it was triggered with
Spellblade
.
If the storing keg was attacked with a new instance of
Spellblade
, it will override the previously stored damage (if different).
Damage can only be stored if
Spellblade
was consumed by
Gangplank
.
The stored damage is static and will not change if
Gangplank's
base
attack damage or ability power (see below) changes.
Specific
Spellblade
item interactions:
Bloodsong
: Dealing damage with kegs to champions won't apply
Expose Weakness
to them.
Iceborn Gauntlet
: The frost field will be created on the location of the keg that is attacked.
Lich Bane
: The
magic damage
will be added to the explosions' damage, but will be dealt as
physical damage
.
Trinity Force
: Attacking kegs grants the movespeed from
Quicken
, but not dealing damage with them.
Placed barrels do
not
grant
vision
until they explode, but they are revealed to
Gangplank
.
If
Gangplank
loses allied vision, for instance due to
nearsight
, he will also lose vision on his barrels temporarily.
Barrels prematurely grant
sight
of their explosion radius (including across terrain and into bushes) if
Parrrley
or a lit fuse is travelling towards them.
This area reveal happens even if
Parrrley
is not going to make it explode.
An exploding
Powder Keg
will splash
Parrrley's
bonus
damage, and will also be modified if the attack
critically strikes
.
Attacks against
Powder Kegs
will apply
on-hit
effects (such as
Tiamat's
Cleave
), but
proc damage
against the barrel itself is reduced to 0.
Damage from
on-hit
effects will
not
increase the damage of the explosion.
Spellblade
is a
special-cased exception
.
Dead Man's Plate's
Crushing Blow
will not trigger from
Powder Kegs
destroyed from
Gangplank
, even with
Parrrley
.
The number of
Powder Kegs
in stock is visible under
Gangplank's
health bar
for all players.
Gangplank
stocks
Powder Kegs
even if the ability hasn't been learned yet.
This is due to the recharge rate at level 1 being set the same as level 0.
While at maximum charges, ranking up the ability to rank 3 or 5 grants the remaining charge immediately regardless of the recharge timer.
If a barrel is destroyed during the
0.
33
seconds
-delay between explosions,
Gangplank
will plunder
gold
and
Silver Serpents
upon killing enemies as if he had done so using
Parrrley
.
(bug)
This effect persists through
death
and will only end upon killing an enemy with
Parrrley

As unpredictable as he is brutal, the dethroned reaver king Gangplank is feared far and wide. Once, he ruled the port city of Bilgewater, and while his reign is over, there are those who believe this has only made him more dangerous. Gangplank would see Bilgewater bathed in blood once more before letting someone else take it—and now with pistol, cutlass, and barrels of gunpowder, he is determined to reclaim what he has lost.

Energized by a mysterious amulet containing Viego of Camavor and wielding the Blade of the Ruined King, Gangplank's personality erupted as he raged in search of the long-lost Isolde. Though ultimately freed of the King's influence by a group of heroes, he carries the experience with him... a reminder, perhaps, of true power.

Trivia

]
Original Gangplank
During development he was simply called
Pirate
or
Rogal Cheastbeard
.
Gangplank was named after the eponymous
disembarkation
device.
Gangplank is
voiced
by
Dennis Collins Johnson
, who also voices
Heimerdinger
and
Taric
.
Parrrley
being spelled with three R's references
the pop culture pirate rendition
and how Gangplank ironically negotiates (as per the word's definition) by killing his opponents and plundering them.
Remove Scurvy
references the real-world disease of
scurvy
, a disease common in sailors caused by a deficiency in Vitamin C. The high Vitamin C content in oranges is in turn a tongue-in-cheek way to say that eating them can "remove scurvy".
NA Summoner 'SantiagoBR'
is the creator of the
'But I ate some oranges and it was K'
meme.
During Closed Beta 1 of development, Gangplank didn't have a beard. This was changed in Closed Beta 3. An image of him in this state can be viewed
here
.
His secondary role is
Support
.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
original icon of
Parrrley
was used to represent the "Bug Reports" section.
Gangplank, the Saltwater Scourge
Gangplank is voiced by
Matthew Mercer
, who also voices
Captain Gangplank
and
Wolf
.
He became the first champion to:
Receive two
visual updates
(the first based on his Chinese artwork and the second based on
Burning Tides
).
Have four Classic skins (counting
Captain Gangplank
before being disabled in-game after 'dying' in Burning Tides).
Temporarily replace the
announcer
in every single map.
One of the scrapped spells tested during Gangplank's visual gameplay update summoned a "pirate
Gundam
" that fired mid-range cannonballs from its arm and attacked with a miniature version of
Unstoppable Force
.

Specialist
Specialists
are champions that do not fit into the "neat little boxes" of the other classes, and represent Riot's ideal of having a champion roster with a lot of distinctiveness and diversity.
Examples
Azir
Teemo
Heimerdinger
Singed
Gangplank
League of Legends content
Fighter (Legacy)
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
League of Legends content
Top
Within a
drafted team
, the
Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts
,
Divers
,
Battlemages
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Top Lane
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Powder Keg
RECHARGE:
17 / 16 / 15 / 14 / 13
Active:
Gangplank
places a
Powder Keg
at the target location, which can be basic attacked or
shot
to damage it. If an enemy destroys a
Powder Keg
, it is safely dismantled.
If
Gangplank
destroys a
Powder Keg
, it will explode to deal the
attack's damage
to nearby enemies and
slow
them. Against an enemy
champion
, the explosion additionally deals
bonus
physical damage
and ignores a
portion of their armor
.
The explosion will cause nearby
Powder Kegs
to also explode.
Gangplank
stocks a
Powder Keg
every few seconds, up to a maximum.
League of Legends content
Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Active:
Gangplank
shoots the target enemy with his pistol, dealing
physical damage
and applying
on-hit

on-attack
effects.
If this attack kills the target, he gains
gold
and
Silver Serpents
.
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike

Nilah's
Jubilant Veil

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind
and
dodge
take precedence over
block

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge

Dodge
.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp

Physical damage

Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Cast instance
Cast instance is the identifier that tells the
source
of spells. Multiple spells, such as basic attacks and abilities, under the same cast instance behave as one for certain interactions. Some notable examples:
Conqueror's
stacking can only be triggered once per cast instance.
Electrocute
and
Phase Rush
can only receive 1 stack for their activation per cast instance.
Muramana
deals its damage once per cast instance.
Not to be confused with damage instance, which is each individual effects, even under the same cast instance.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
