The splash damage will critically strike when the basic attack does, but will not deal any bonus damage.
Call of the Freljord
range to be shared with allies is based on
Nunu
and
Willump's
location.
If no ally is prioritized based on their stats, it will be given to the one closest to them.
Enemies that can trigger
Call of the Freljord
have a marker overhead.
This marker isn't present on inhibitors or the nexus (because they cannot hold buffs and debuffs including the one that hosts this VFX), but they still trigger
Call of the Freljord
when attacked.

for a long duration to create a
snowball
that grows in size and speed.
Willump
can gradually steer the snowball during this time. When hitting
minions
and small
monsters
, the snowball rolls over them, dealing
magic damage
. When hitting an enemy
champion

knocking them up
then
stunning
them based on the snowball's size.

Willump
automatically navigates his movement in the direction of the cursor and can steer the snowball with a
slow turn rate
that increases over time, resetting upon changing direction. The duo have their

The initial cast and the manual recast count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and
Force Pulse
.
The movement speed reduction the duo receive from initially casting
Biggest Snowball Ever!
is not considered a
slow
, thus it will not be resisted by their
slow immunity
.
There are 3 stages where the turn rate increases from the original one:
After turning for 1 second, the turn rate is increased to 175%.
After turning for 3 seconds, the turn rate is increased to 250%.
After turning for 6 seconds, the turn rate is increased to 325% where it caps.
The time threshold to begin gaining bonus movement speed may be bugged, as Flat Bonus MS increases the time while % Bonus MS decreases the time.
The formula appears to be (X ÷ 100) - Y, where:
X =
Total
Flat MS after caps
Y = 0.
1
per 1% %MS
The delay is not modified from its initially calculated value on-cast, even if additional movement speed is gained.
Nunu and Willump
keep all increases in
movement speed
at time of cast for the duration of the charge.
Nunu and Willump's
movement speed always increases in increments of ~14, reaching the greater value between
「
Total
MS +
85 − 255 (based on level)
」
「
Total
Uncapped
Flat MS +
85 − 255 (based on level)
」
(
click to toggle
).
This takes 6 increments to reach the
Total
MS + 85, but may take more to reach the Uncapped Flat + 85. Due to flat bonuses increasing the time threshold, it is possible for the ability's effects to end before reaching the
total
uncapped movement speed.
The
bonus
movement speed ignores the
movement speed cap
.
If
Nunu
turns continuously he will create a
600
unit circle, increased with
bonus
movement speed, striking the same point up to 3 times, for a maximum of
180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360
(+ 300% AP)
magic damage
. The damage can be further increased by detonating the snowball, for a
total
of
360 / 450 / 540 / 630 / 720
(+450% AP)
magic damage
.
Ryze's
Realm Warp
will only teleport
Nunu and Willump
, leaving the
snowball
behind.
Hovering the cursor on the HUD (e.g
mini map
/ champion portraits) does not affect the cast and steering of
Biggest Snowball Ever!
.
Nunu
gains a slightly larger field of view during
Biggest Snowball Ever!
.
Biggest Snowball Ever!
is disabled for the first 15 seconds of the game.
Displacement immunity
will not resist the application of the

Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to prove he was a hero by slaying a fearsome monster—only to discover that the beast, a lonely and magical yeti, merely needed a friend. Bound together by ancient power and a shared love of snowballs, Nunu and Willump now ramble wildly across the Freljord, breathing life into imagined adventures. They hope that somewhere out there, they will find Nunu’s mother. If they can save her, maybe they will be heroes after all…

Despite the destruction of their respective homes, Nunu and Willump hold onto the innocence that so many have lost. Bel'Veth, having never seen such joy even in the face of despair, bestowed cosmic power upon them. Now they spread that joy wherever they go, fighting the Dark Star's destructive force with their own creativity and boundless imagination.

Whenever Nunu's head hit his pillow, from under the bed came a tap-tap-tapping. Willump urged him to ignore it, but the yap-yap-yapping tugged at Nunu's ear. Unable to resist, he crawled beneath and made friends with a little clown who filled his dreams of summer camp glory.

Trivia

]
Nunu, the Yeti Rider
Nunu was named after
Steve 'Guinsoo' Feak's
dog.
[2]
Nunu
is also a nickname for his wife.
[3]
The update in patch
V7.16
that made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI showed the portrait of
Willump
instead of Nunu for every skin except for his
Original
skin.
Absolute Zero
was named after
the theoretical temperature
at which matter stops moving completely (referencing both slows the ability has) and has the highest single
ability power
ratio in-game (
300%
).
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called
"Nunurf"
, referencing
Urf
.
The Boy and his Yeti
Nunu & Willump drop a
soul each.
Their dance is an updated version of their old animation in which
Willump
dances and
Nunu
provides
flute
music.
Willump
was most likely inspired by several characters from different media, such as:
Stitch
from the
Lilo & Stitch
franchise,
Wild Thing from
Where the Wild Things Are
series,
Appa
from
Avatar: The Last Airbender
series.

Vanguards
are offensive tanks. Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at bringing the action. Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to follow-up to devastating effect.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the

League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends
. Each champion possesses unique abilities and
attributes
.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt
)
Silence
(
Disrupt
,
Polymorph
)
Sleep
Stasis
Stun

Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.
"
Cleanse
" does not always refer to the act of removing
all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.
A
cleanse

Stasis

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
The
strength
is reduced by
slow resist

Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
