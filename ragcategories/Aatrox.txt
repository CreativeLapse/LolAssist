The highlighted areas denote the sweetspot - enemies are affected where the two areas overlap (See
edge range
and
center range
).
The first and second casts function like any point-blank AOE (i.e. an effect centered on the caster). An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on
edge range
- i.e. if any part of your
gameplay radius
is within the hitbox, you are affected.
The third cast, as well as the
Sweetspot
for the first and second cast, function like
ground-targeted
abilities. An enemy is considered to be hit by the ability based on
center range
- i.e. an enemy's center has to be within the hitbox to be affected.
As implied by the previous point, the
Sweetspot
for the first and second cast is implemented as separate
areas of effect
to the main component of the ability. Enemies must be within both areas to trigger the bonus damage,
knock up
and
Deathbringer Stance's
cooldown reduction.
The 'target gets hit' SFX plays whenever an enemy is within the
Sweetspot
- meaning it is possible to trigger the sound effect without affecting an enemy.
In the game,
Sweetspot
damage is incorrectly displayed as
a real critical strike.
(bug)
Each cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
The hitbox and
Aatrox's
model are fixed to the initial target direction.
Aatrox's
facing-direction, for effects such as
Petrifying Gaze
, is the direction he is moving, and not the direction the model is facing.
All damage modifiers
stack multiplicatively
.
There's a small period of time in which Aatrox can't declare basic attacks after casting
The Darkin Blade
.
(note)
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Projectile
Blocked
The impact area is oriented relative to
Aatrox's
position when the projectile hits, not where the projectile originated from.
The location that the target is dragged to is not at the target's original location, but slightly closer towards
Aatrox's
position when the zone expires.
Spell shield
will block the chain's application and initial damage but not the aftereffects of one already applied.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

The

This may upscale his dash speed so that the dash takes the same total time as the standard maximum-range dash.
If

Umbral Dash

Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.

Aatrox is a violent and notorious crime lord whose name is feared throughout the criminal underworld. He is also disfigured by Ora abuse. Seeking to purge the substance from his body, he abducts Templars to extract it—and kills them when they are unable to do so.

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
Aatrox, the Darkin Blade
Out-of-universe,
Aatrox
is a word play on Latin
atrox
"fierce, savage, cruel" in turn from
ater
"dull black, dark", from root
PIE
*h₂eh₁ter-
"fire";
[2]
All of these reference the
Darkin
weapon's physical manifestation and demonic nature (punning on
dark kin
), various
historical fire-based weapons
, the
scorched earth
strategy, and his '
war as an artform
' philosophy. Latin
atrox
gives rise to Anglo-French
atrocity.
Aatrox,
Dr. Mundo
,
Mordekaiser
,
Vladimir
, and
Zac
are the only champions that use their own
health
as a resource for
abilities
.
Enemies hit by
Massacre
will leave a blood trail between themselves and Aatrox that he will rapidly absorb (this is a remaining visual effect from PBE testing, where Aatrox would gain attack speed based on how many enemies had been hit by
Massacre
, that was recycled in
V5.6
).
Aatrox can still use emotes during
Blood Well's
revive.
Sterak's Gage
is speculated to have been
Aatrox's
missing left arm glove. Its passive was also coincidentally similar to Aatrox's.
Prior to his rework, on the statement "This champion needs an update", players ranked Aatrox 5th in NA; 4th in BR; 3rd in KR and 14th in CN. He ranked 4th overall.
[3]
Aatrox, the Darkin Blade
Aatrox is the first champion, since
Lulu's
patch
introduced champion specific
login screens
, to receive two login screens and themes released for his Classic skin.
In-game, Aatrox can toggle his banner-style wings and his sword stance [default: Ctrl + 5].
Aatrox
is one of 21 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Camille

Darius

The icon for
World Ender
is reused for the
Teamfight Tactics
item
Darkin
.
Aatrox's Series 1
Eternals
make the following references:
Chains Yanked
references the idiom
yank one's chain
as well as the pull of
Infernal Chains
.
QQ's
references the

as well the multi-cast nature of

Blood Well
Blood Well
is a resource that indicates the remaining duration of
Aatrox's
World Ender
in seconds. It is represented beneath the
health bar
and is
white
. It fills when
World Ender
is used and depletes over the duration of the ability.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

The Darkin Blade
COOLDOWN:
14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6
Aatrox
can cast this ability up to three times in a short amount of time before it goes on
cooldown
.
Active:
Aatrox
performs an attack with his greatsword in the target direction, dealing
physical damage
to enemies within an area. The area varies and the damage increases per cast. Enemies within each area's
Sweetspot
receive increased damage and are briefly
knocked up
.
First Cast:
Aatrox
strikes his greatsword in a long rectangle.
Second Cast:
Aatrox
slashes his greatsword in a wide trapezoid.
Third Cast:
Aatrox
slams his greatsword in a circle.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Infernal Chains
COOLDOWN:
20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12

Aatrox
sends a chain in the target direction that deals
magic damage
and
slows
the first enemy hit.
If this hits an enemy
champion
or large
monster
, it creates a
revealing
tether
between them and the ground. If the tether is not broken after a brief moment, they are dealt
magic damage
and
pulled back
to the center.

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities

epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's

.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing

airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
The
strength
is reduced by
slow resist

Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
