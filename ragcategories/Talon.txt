Talon
will track the target if they change locations with the ranged version of
Noxian Diplomacy
, landing at an offset of 100 units before reaching them.
He will dash to the target's previous location while still dealing damage if the target is too far away or moves beyond
800
units.
When cast in close range,
Noxian Diplomacy
deals its damage at the completion of the cast time, rather than at the dash's completion.
The damage will be dealt even if
Talon's
dash is interrupted, so long as the cast time is completed.
Talon
will be ordered to basic attack the target at the end of the dash.
While
grounded
or
rooted
,
Noxian Diplomacy
can only be cast within close range.
Talon
will still dash to the target in both cases.
Noxian Diplomacy
will also grant the heal if the target dies upon
Talon's
completion of the dash.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on
cooldown
nor pay its cost (if applicable).
This only applies to the close dash attack.

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Casting
Rake
when an enemy is within 650 radius and 26° angle in front of
Talon
will reveal him from the fog of war like a targeted cast.
(bug)
This is because of
Rake's
internal Cone targeting type, which defaults to "targeting" all units in the preset area and thereby trigger revealing the caster if not toggled off for the spell.
If
Talon
dies while
Rake
is mid-air, the projectiles will still complete their travel.
The blades each will fail to return to
Talon
if he is somehow too far from them after the delay.
This maximum distance is 5000 units at ranks 1-4 of
Rake
, or 20000 units at rank 5 of
Rake
.
(bug)
The latter distance is barely achievable between fountains on Summoner's Rift.

Talon is the knife in the darkness, a merciless killer able to strike without warning and escape before any alarm is raised. He carved out a dangerous reputation on the brutal streets of Noxus, where he was forced to fight, kill, and steal to survive. Adopted by the notorious Du Couteau family, he now plies his deadly trade at the empire’s command, assassinating enemy leaders, captains, and heroes… as well as any Noxian foolish enough to earn the scorn of their masters.

.
Noxian Diplomacy's
bleed icon
is shaped into Talon's arm blade.
Cutthroat
makes use of a
double entendre
:
The word '
cutthroat
' is defined as murderous or cruel, which describes Talon well.
The ability has Talon literally cut the throat of his target. This is made more clear in the first iteration of the ability, which also
silenced
the target.

His official name
Talon
originates from Latin
talus
"
ankle
"; which possibly later underwent
semantic shift
to "
heel
>
spur
>

".
His title might be referencing his loyalty to General Du Couteau (the General being the 'Blade' -
couteau
is French for 'knife' - and Talon being the 'Shadow').

Some scrapped spells tested on
Talon

[4]
A spell where Talon throws out knives to create a slow field, but if he left its proximity it would break the field.
A spell where Talon could throw out a knife that could be reactivated and allow him to blink to its location.
Shadow Assault
was originally tested as a basic spell.
Talon was named after his bird like appearance and his large hand blade. His spells carry a metaphor by utilizing the concept of his cloak blades as a string of “feathers”.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.

Default damage
Default damage

default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less

large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment

Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
The
strength
is reduced by
slow resist
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
and
slow immunity
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
(except
Yone's
Soul Unbound
recast),
Garen's
Decisive Strike
,
Master Yi's
Highlander
and
Nunu's
Biggest Snowball Ever!

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Unobstructed vision
A unit with
unobstructed sight
can see the full circle of their
vision
radius, ignoring all obstructions and being able to see into terrain. This effect does not allow the user to see into
brush
, although they will be able to see beyond the brush if within range.
Having
unobstructed sight
will benefit all forms of vision, including
true sight
and
camouflage
detection - i.e. you will be able to reveal stealthed units over walls where usually terrain would block true sight.
Nearsight
prevents this vision entirely; the user's sight radius will not infiltrate beyond terrain.
League of Legends content
Stasis
A unit that is in
stasis
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use
any
summoner spell
for the duration, while also being
invulnerable
and
untargetable
.
Stasis
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), all
channeled and charged
abilities and all
dashes
and
displacements
. Units that are being
knocked up
will be placed on the ground, but aren't
knocked down
(the
airborne
status is not removed in this case).
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Epic monsters
and
turrets
are special cased to be affected by
stasis
despite them being
crowd control immune
.
Removal:
Cannot be removed by any means (except through
death
), and will prevent the activation of abilities that would usually remove
crowd control
effects.
Quicksilver
will either be placed on a short cooldown, remain usable, or become disabled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
