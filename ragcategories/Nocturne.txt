Periodically,
Nocturne's

him for each enemy hit. Basic attacks

Innate:
Periodically,
Nocturne
empowers his next
basic attack
to slash in a circle, dealing
120% AD
physical damage
to the target and nearby enemies and
healing
himself for
13 − 30 (based on level)
(+ 30% AP)
per enemy hit. Against
minions
,
Umbra Blade's
damage to secondary targets and healing are reduced by 50% and it applies
on-hit
effects
(note)
to all targets at 100% effectiveness.
Umbra Blades
can
critically strike
against the primary target, modifying the

The primary target of the enhanced attack takes
basic damage
while the secondary targets of the slash are dealt
default damage
.
The enhanced attack will apply other
on-hit effects
(only to main target) and can
critically strike
as normal.
The critical strike damage of the attack is notably unusual.
(note)
It stems from a time where critical strikes by default did
200% AD
damage, which meant that 110% of it equaled
220% AD
, equal to a more standard
Umbral Blades'
bonus damage of
20% AD
added to the critical damage. This also causes bonus critial damage such as
Infinity Edge's
passive to be 10% stronger on the attack.
Now, the formula reduces the expected critical damage slightly by
-2.
5
% AD
, which is 10% of the reduction in base critical damage from
Pre-Season 11
.
The empowered attack will not trigger against
structures
nor
wards
.
Basic attacks against them will still grant the cooldown reduction.
Parry effects will only block the damage dealt to the primary target.

checks for and hits targets 25 units outside of the missile's maximum range.
Duskbringer's
damage is not increased by the
bonus
AD
gained from its trail, meaning that casting it again while on the trail from the last cast will not result in higher damage.
It is observed from seasons ago that this is intentionally hard-coded into the ability to avoid the projectile increasing its own damage. This feature is somewhat deprecated as it also limits chain-casting
Duskbringer

Duskbringer's Dusk Trail

A demonic amalgamation drawn from the nightmares that haunt every sentient mind, the thing known as Nocturne has become a primordial force of pure evil. It is liquidly chaotic in aspect, a faceless shadow with cold eyes and armed with wicked-looking blades. After freeing itself from the spirit realm, Nocturne descended upon the waking world, to feed upon the kind of terror that can only thrive in true darkness.

The great corpses of the Old Gods fed the land, and in time even the Elderwood would come to grow over their putrid rot–hiding it, perhaps, for a time. But the Gods never truly died and, with the resurgence of the Coven, one has risen again–Nocturne, the Eternal Nightmare.

Not every part of the Hextech renaissance led to bright innovations. A clandestine experiment to fuse Hextech with demonic energies wrought a living nightmare, a predator rumored to stalk the streets and back alleyways of the city. Authorities report that any such creation would have been terminated along with any such project, and that any missing persons reports are, of course, completely unrelated.

As the oldest member of the Aspirants, Nocturne is content to lead from the shadows, having long ago exchanged their physical form for pure Aspira. Within the catacombs, they jealously guard the vast well of Aspira the congregation has filled over the centuries, toiling away at the unholy weapon that will destroy the Neverghaast once and for all.

A nightmarish dimensional parasite, Nocturne was drawn to the Foreglow and—as it burrowed its way to the power's raw form—inadvertently created the first dimensional collapse and the first Empyrean, Pyke. With the Foreglow corrupting its original appearance, Nocturne seeks to experiment further with the Foreglow and find new ways to feed its hunger.

Nocturne
comes from the French
nocturne
, which is derived from the Latin
nocturnus
"of the night".
Umbra Blades
is named after Latin
umbra
for shade or shadow.
Nocturne was the first champion to be previewed at a major event prior to release (
PAX
East 2011).
He was also previewed in
IGN

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center

abilities.
It is
less

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Ghosted
A unit that is
ghosted
ignores
unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Obscured vision
An
obscured
target only has their position revealed to the enemy—such as through a silhouette or movement pattern as a visual effect—but their unit remains an un-rendered target for selection (i.e. they cannot be selected for
unit-targeted
attacks, draw
monster
aggro). The revealed silhouettes' color is different among
champions
, wards, and all other non-champion units (default:
red
,
blue
, and
purple
; respectively).
This is distinct from being
untargetable
, as an
obscured unit
is still vulnerable to
auras
,
direction-targeted
and
ground-targeted
effects, and
auto-targeted
effects that do not require
sight
of targets.
Obscured vision
is not concealed by
nearsight
.
League of Legends content
Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities

epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and

League of Legends content
Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Nearsight
A unit that is
nearsighted
has their
sight
radius reduced and
cannot
see beyond their sight radius.
While nearsighted, units cannot reveal
stealthed
wards
or
traps
. Nearsighted units lose vision of all their allies as well as all external sources of vision (including from wards or abilities). This prevents
unit-targeted
effects, including
basic attacks
, from being used outside of the unit's reduced sight radius.
True sight
and
unobstructed vision
do
not
bypass the vision blocked by
nearsight
.
Sources of
nearsight
do
not
stack with each other; only the application with the greatest sight reduction will take effect.
Interrupts:
Interrupts target commands if the
nearsighted
unit's target is outside of their new vision area and prevents
automated target acquisition
.
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
with the exceptions of
Fiora's
Riposte
and
Morgana's
Black Shield
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
with the exceptions of
Yone's
Soul Unbound
(recast),
Cleanse
, and
Mikael's Blessing
.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
