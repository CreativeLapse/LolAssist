Living Forge
Forge Disable Time
:
4
Innate - Living Forge:
Ornn
can
purchase
items from anywhere by
channeling
for a few seconds.
Innate - Master Craftsman:
At levels 13 and above,
Ornn
, he can upgrade a nearby ally's item into a Masterwork item.
Ornn
increases his
bonus
health
,
armor
and
magic resist
from all sources, further increased each time he makes a Masterwork item.
Innate - Temper:
Ornn's
basic attacks against
Brittle
targets
knock them back
.
Immobilizing
effects against Brittle targets will consume the debuff to deal
bonus
magic damage
based on the
target's
maximum health
.
Innate - Living Forge:
Ornn
can purchase non-
consumable
items
from anywhere on the field by forging them himself, and is also presented a
Forge Menu
to quickly forge his recommended items. Once
Ornn
selects an item to forge, he
channels
for 4 seconds, building the item and paying its
gold
cost upon completion. The channel is
interrupted
if
Ornn
takes damage from enemy
champions
or
turrets
.
Living Forge
is disabled for 4 seconds after starting the channel.
Innate - Master Craftsman:
Ornn
uses his craftsmanship in forgery to upgrade most
Legendary items
that he and his teammates own into
Masterwork
items, increasing the
gold value
of all
upgradeable stats
by exactly
1000
, shared equally among them. When
Ornn
reaches
level
13, the first eligible
Legendary item
in his inventory is upgraded automatically. For each level after 13 and before 18 (levels 14–17, total of 4, once per ally per game),
Ornn
can upgrade the first eligible
Legendary item
in an allied champion's inventory into its
Masterwork
variant. He can do so by selecting the ally while within 600 range, and forges the item by performing
Living Forge's
channel
.
Additionally,
Ornn
increases his
bonus
armor
,
bonus
magic resistance
and
bonus
health
by 10% from all sources, further increased by 4% each time he upgrades a
Legendary
item into a
Masterwork
item, for a total increase of 30% to each stat after the maximum of 5 upgrades.
Innate - Temper:
Ornn's
basic attacks
against
Brittle
enemies
knock them back
a short distance.
Ornn's
and allies'
immobilizing
effects against
Brittle
enemies will consume the debuff to deal
bonus
magic damage
equal to
10% − 18% (based on
Ornn's
level)
of the target's
maximum
health
, capped at 250 against
monsters
, and cause the crowd control to last 30% longer (if applicable).
Ornn
will prioritize upgrading the first Legendary item eligible for a
Masterwork
upgrade based on its position in the inventory, detecting each slot until an eligible item is found.
"The weapons I forge do not have names. They have ambitions."

Masterwork
items inherit all properties of their pre-upgrade version, including the cooldowns of their
effects
. Internally, they are handled through an item modifier. An upgraded item gains the
(
Masterwork
)
descriptor next to its name in tooltips as well as a special Masterwork frame overlay on the item's icon itself, both indicating the application of
Living Forge's
modifier.
Statistics' gold value for
Masterwork
item purposes is shown in the following table. The table also indicates all upgradeable stats.

per 1 point of

.
18
per 1 point of
magic resistance
.
1 point of
health
has a variable
gold value
, based on the number of upgradeable stats that exist on the item:
If health is the item's only upgradeable stat, it receives +375 health and health is valued at
2.
6
per point.
If the item has health and only one other upgradeable stat, it receives +185 health and health is valued at
2.
702
per point.
If the item has health and two other upgradeable stats, it receives +125 health and health is valued at
2.
6
per point.
If the item has health and three other upgradeable stats, it receives +90 health and health is valued at
2.
7
per point.
While not currently possible, if an item has no upgradeable stats,
1000
worth of health (valued at
2.
6
per point) is added to the item.
[2]
Decimal values are not displayed for stats in
Masterwork
items' tooltips, but they are still granted as normal.
Health and mana items built on the field will retain
Ornn's
previous
health
and
mana
percentage. Returning to base still brings health and mana back to full.
Ornn's
basic attacks against
Brittle
enemies will end the duration of the debuff
on-hit
prematurely even if the
knock back
is not applied.
His basic attacks against
Brittle
epic
monsters
will still render the debuff without the
knock back
being applied against them.
Brittle's
Tenacity
reduction will benefit all applicable types of
crowd control
, not just
immobilizes
. The following do not consume
Brittle
but benefit from the reduction:
blinds
,
cripples
,
disarms
,
grounding
,
silences
, and
slows
.
Spell shield
will block both the knock back and the bonus damage from
Ornn's
empowered
brittle
attack.
The
bonus
magic damage
inflicted by
Brittle
is credited to
Ornn
, and benefits from his
magic penetration

Tips & Tricks
Although
airborne
effects won't be extended by
Brittle
, if the spell simultaneously
stuns
the target, this stun will be extended and persist past the airborne duration, for an overall increased crowd control duration.
Ornn's
Searing Charge
and
Call of the Forge God
each apply both airborne and stun simultaneously for the same duration for this reason.

Ornn is the Freljordian spirit of forging and craftsmanship. He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home. There he stokes bubbling cauldrons of molten rock to purify ores and fashion items of unsurpassed quality. When other deities—especially Volibear—walk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.

In an age before man, King Ornn ruled the craggy southlands, and he was as rocky and lifeless as they were. It is said that he weathered an endless siege from his brother, the great King Voli, and that the blood they spilled sprouted grass and trees and animals, even as they became like beasts themselves.

The drop before the bass, the creator of the primordial instruments, a literal God of Groove, Ornn has been instrumental in spreading The Groove through the Galaxy. But he's not a fan of the celebrity status it's earned him, hermiting himself away on a planet of whirling pools of goo to focus on his work. If Ornn is coming to party, it better be legendary.

With a toot of his whistle, Ornn calls forth a mighty iron beast, roaring with his forge's fury. As his hammer pounds out a rhythm like pistons on the track, a soot-soaked grin unfurls beneath his smoldering beard. One imagines he must feel the thrill of creation, the joy of a perfect machine made manifest!

V14.12
Living Forge
New Easter Egg:
Upon applying a Masterwork upgrade to a
Rabadon's Deathcap
owned by
Ornn
or
Aurora
, the item will transform into a
Witch's Hat
. The Masterwork item has the intended Masterwork stat bonus but also has a new icon and includes a caption that reads:
"'Friend.' Yes, it is a funny word. Yet perhaps I understand its purpose."
V14.11

Removed:
Masterwork items no longer have unique names.
New Effect:
All Legendary items can now be upgraded into Masterwork items.
This excludes
Mejai's Soulstealer
and Legendary items that can be upgraded such as all
Support
items,
Vigilant Wardstone
, and all
Tear of the Goddess
upgrades (
Archangel's Staff
,
Manamune
,
Winter's Approach
).
Upon an item being upgraded into its Masterwork variant, it gains the
(
Masterwork
)
descriptor and has certain innate stats increased based on a table of values.
Statistics' gold value is represented by the following table, which also lists the ones which can be upgraded. This table also formally represents Riot's official stance on each statistic's gold efficiency, although not all stat types are included for the purposes of Masterwork items.
31.
25
/1
ability haste
(explicit)
20
/1
ability power
(
Amplifying Tome
400
÷ 20
ability power
)
35
/1
attack damage
(
Long Sword
350
÷ 10
attack damage
)
30
/1%
attack speed
(
Dagger
300
÷ 10%
attack speed
)
20
/1
armor
(
Cloth Armor
300
÷ 15
armor
)
18
/1
magic resistance
(
Null-Magic Mantle
450
÷ 25
magic resistance
)
Variable gold
/1
health
, based on how many upgradeable stats exist on the item:
If the item has health only, health on that item is valued at
2.
6
per point (
Ruby Crystal
400
÷ 150
health
).
If the item has health and only one other upgradeable stat, health on that item is valued at
2.
702
per point.
If the item has health and two other upgradeable stats, health on that item is valued at
2.
6
per point (
Ruby Crystal
400
÷ 150
health
).
If the item has health and three other (or more) upgradeable stats, health on that item is valued at
2.
7
per point.
While not currently possible, if an item has no upgradeable stats,
1000
worth of health will be added to the item.
[3]
The total gold value of all increased stats remains at
1000
. However, old Masterwork items only considered this value a general guideline (for the sake of cleaner numbers on the increased stats); the new upgraded items' value increases by precisely
1000
as a strict rule (according to the above table).
All stats that are increased share equal gold value. For example, if an item has
attack damage
and
attack speed
, each upgraded stat will increase by
500 gold
of value; if an item has
ability haste
,
armor
, and
magic resistance
, each upgraded stat will increase by
333.
3
gold
of value; etc.
Note that the values are rounded down in item tooltips, but are granted as normal.

V7.17
August 24th Hotfix
Living Forge
Bug Fix:
Mitigated a lag issue caused by
Ornn's
mini-shop UI updating after he purchased an item outside his base. Until 7.18, the UI will only show basic items and won't update as
Ornn
makes purchases.
Bug Fix:
This also solves an issue where the mini-shop UI told Ornn to buy things way too expensive for him to afford.

Added
Living Forge
Innate:
Ornn
can purchase non-consumable items from anywhere on the field by forging them himself, and is also presented a
Forge Menu
with his recommended items to select to be
forged
. Forging takes 4 seconds and the process is interrupted if
Ornn
enters combat, disabling
Living Forge
for 4 seconds.
Additionally,
Ornn
and each of his teammates can purchase
Masterwork
upgrades. Each player may only have one
Masterwork
upgrade at a time.

Ornn's dance references
Attila's
dance
during the song
I've Got a Dream
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
The language used in the musical accompaniment for The Path To Hearth-Home is described, in-universe, as "Ancient Freljordian".
[4]
It is based on Old Norse, and can be mostly understood by
North Germanic speakers
, like Icelanders, Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, etc. & to a lesser extent
West Germanic speakers
like English people, Germans, Netherlanders (Dutch people), etc.
The singer is
Nunu's
mother
Layka
, voiced by Norwegian-Swedish composer
Christine Hals
, who has worked on Disney's cartoon
Frozen
soundtracks;
[5]
Ancient Freljordian is linguistically related to the Runeterran lingua franca (real-life English), due to in-universe cognates.
Ornn
is a pre-Freljordian theonym, with forgotten meaning;
[6]
Ornn
resembles Old Norse verb
*oʀna
ᚢᛉᚾᚨ "to warm up" < Proto-Germanic
*uznanan
<
PIE
*Hus-n̥eh₂-
.
[7]
The
horned, caprinine appearance
of
Ornn's
and his
summoned element's
may be referencing:
Thor's goats
Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr
;
The
horned
Indo-European pastoral god(s).
In-universe, Ornn names
hammer
after the verb; vice-versa in reality.
The icon for
Living Forge
is reused for the
Teamfight Tactics
item
Reforger
.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's

Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage

Howling Abyss
The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
Freljord
. Legends say that, long ago, a great battle took place here on the narrow bridge spanning this chasm. No one remembers who fought here, or why, but it is said that if you listen carefully to the wind you can still hear the cries of the vanquished tossed howling into the Abyss.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
