Inherent Glamour
Innate:
Neeko
has a collection of disguises to take on the appearance of allied champions. She can choose a new champion to switch her disguise or select herself to deactivate her disguise. Standing near a non-champion unit will collect its
Sho'Ma
, adding its disguise to the collection. She can collect only one
Sho'Ma
, but can discard or consume it. The disguise will break when
Neeko
takes "lethal" damage, becomes
immobilized
, or performs her damaging abilities. This will also incur the cooldown.
Innate:
Neeko
has a collection of disguises to take on the appearance of allied champions. She can choose a new champion to switch her disguise or select herself to deactivate her disguise, placing
Inherent Glamour
on a 0.
5
-second cooldown. Taking damage from a
champion
or
turret
puts
Inherent Glamour
on a 2-second cooldown.
Standing by the
nearest
visible
allied or neutral non-champion non-structure unit while not disguised will gather its
Sho'Ma
over 2 seconds, adding its disguise to the collection. Activating this disguise places
Inherent Glamour
on a 1-second cooldown.
Neeko
can collect only one
Sho'Ma
, but can discard or consume it. She can store
Sho'Ma
from the following units:
Non-epic
monsters
Minions
Traps
Wards
Pets
Jungle plants
While disguised,
Neeko
can use basic attacks while keeping her form. Her disguise breaks if her form takes lethal damage or if she becomes
immobilized
, deals damage to a
structure
with a non-champion form, or uses a damaging
ability
,
summoner spell
, or
item active
.
Inherent Glamour's disguise is not deactivated from
Pop Blossom
until after 0.
5
seconds of its cast.
Neeko
cannot activate Inherent Glamour while she is unable to cast abilities.
Info
Targeting input
Passive
Neeko
can store up the
Sho'Ma
of multiple units at a time.
Inherent Glamour's
cooldown only prevents
Neeko
from activating disguises; she can still store and remove
Sho'Ma
while the passive is on cooldown.
If
Neeko
attempts to activate a disguise while near and for the trap, ward, or jungle plant she stored
Sho'Ma
for, she will leap to that unit's exact position over 1 second and then become disguised. If she does so for a monster and is near its respective jungle camp, she will leap to that monster's usual position in the camp.
She will fail to activate the disguise after the leap if she is affected by the same conditions that would break a disguise.
Neeko
will copy aesthetics as well as superficial mechanical
statistics
. She will fake a number of readings:
Health bar
(original's current amount becomes her apparent maximum)
Secondary resource
- e.g.
mana
,
energy
or none at all (original's current amount becomes her apparent maximum)
Stats
Buffs
and
debuffs
with their respective icons and VFX/SFX (there are exceptions)
Neeko
sees the buffs that are actually applied to her, while enemies see the disguised champion's buffs.
Kill feed icon
A number of attributes she actually adopts are:
Base movement speed
The melee or ranged classification of the champion
Base attack speed and attack ratio
The projectile or non-projectile quality of their attack
Attack range (adopt the new form
attack range
)
Size
(including size modifiers and base champion size)
Default transformation toggle (non-innate)
Voice lines
Character interactions (jokes, taunts, dances, laughs, toggle effects), as well as their
Recall
animation
Neeko
can copy
Samira's
taunt animation but she will not actually throw the coin via the
Taunt
ability.
Inherent Glamour's
disguise is broken by the following spell casts:
Casting
Blooming Burst
or
Tangle-Barbs
.
Casting
Pop Blossom
will not break the disguise immediately, but after a delay.
Using
Exhaust
,
Ignite
, or
Smite
.
Activating
Hextech Rocketbelt
,
Stridebreaker
, or
Redemption
.
The scoreboard's question mark of
Neeko
(which indicates an enemy is not currently visible to your team) will disappear, if the
disguised
Neeko
is visible. Therefore, it can be used to determine, whether a unit is
Neeko
or not.

Hailing from a long lost tribe of vastaya, Neeko can blend into any crowd by borrowing the appearances of others, even absorbing something of their emotional state to tell friend from foe in an instant. No one is ever sure where—or who—Neeko might be, but those who intend to do her harm will soon witness her true colors revealed, and feel the full power of her primordial spirit magic unleashed upon them.

Burst
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Burst Mages
aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.
Examples
Annie
Syndra
Veigar
League of Legends content
Catcher
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Catchers
specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision

Enchanters

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat

champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's

Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage

basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage

Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
