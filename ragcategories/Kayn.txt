The Darkin Scythe
Innate:
Whenever
Kayn
scores champion
takedowns
or deals damage against champions, he earns orbs that unlocks his
Darkin
and
Shadow Assassin
forms.
Kayn
can return to the
summoning platform
to transform, permanently empowering his abilities.
Shadow Assassin Bonus:
If
Kayn
has been
out of combat
for a period, his attacks deal
bonus
magic damage
for a short time upon entering combat.
Darkin Bonus:
Rhaast
heals
for a portion of the damage he deals to enemy champions with his
abilities
.
Innate:
Kayn
has a secondary
experience bar
that tracks progress toward his
Darkin
and
Shadow Assassin
forms. He gathers orbs from champion
takedowns
and each instance of damage (excluding
damage over time
) dealt against champions. Once he has earned enough orbs, he unlocks a form based on whether he earned more from
melee
or
ranged
champions (for
Darkin
and
Shadow Assassin
, respectively), with the other form unlocked later.
Kayn
can move near the
summoning platform
to transform over 6 seconds, restoring to full
health
and
mana
and becoming
invulnerable
,
untargetable
, and unable to act for the duration.
Kayn
cannot choose a form if he is unable to cast abilities. The transformation will grant a passive bonus and permanently empower some of
Kayn's
abilities based on the form chosen. He gains a one-time
Homeguard
once the transformation is complete.
Shadow Assassin Bonus:
If
Kayn
has been
out of combat
with enemy champions for over 8 seconds, or he casts
Umbral Trespass
, upon entering combat and lasting for 3 seconds, he deals
15% − 45% (based on level)
of
post-mitigation damage
dealt against enemy champions as
bonus
magic damage
, also applying on the first instance of damage dealt. If this effect is ready, it will not be lost by taking damage.
Darkin Bonus:
Rhaast
heals
for 25%
(+ 0.
5
% per 100
bonus
health)
of the
post-mitigation
physical damage
that he deals to enemy champions with his
abilities
.

Entering transformation will not

The Orb System
The experience is depicted as orbs that drop upon the ground.
Melee
champions drop red orbs that grant progress towards
Darkin
, while
ranged
champions drop blue orbs that grant progress for
Shadow Assassin
. Orbs will remain on the ground until automatically collected by
Kayn
regardless of range once he leaves
combat
. The orbs will be collected even if
Kayn
dies
.
The experience bar above his portrait gauges his current progression, the color reflects the form with greater progress.
Kayn
can transform by interacting with his portrait, and can wait 4 minutes until the other form becomes available, reduced by 5 seconds for each collected orb of their type after that.
Melee
orbs grant 2 points per hit and 6 points per takedown.
Ranged
orbs grant 3 points per hit and 7 points per takedown.
The amount of points received per orb is multiplied by
3 − 10.
39
(based on minutes)
.
The bar gets filled up completely at 500 points.
If the two forms are within 8% of each other, the last champion range type hit will determine the winner. If both types are hit at the same time, the trasformation will default to
Darkin
.
Each side's bar has a bucket system, starting at 60 points.
Each time an orb is taken the system checks if there's an amount of points in the bucket equal to or higher than the amount received from the orb.
If there is,
Kayn
is given an additional orb of the same type he received, while also subtracting that amount of points from the bucket.
The bucket fills by 0.
8
points per second if out of champion combat for 70 seconds.
Damage dealt by
damage over time
effects and specifically
First Strike
and
Summon Aery
will not grant orbs.

The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
.
Detonating the ability manually does not.
The ability activation happens when
Kayn
is attached to his target and the channel starts.
Kassadin
cannot gain a stack for
Force Pulse
because
Kayn
is untargetable during the activation.
The ability will recast if
Kayn
is ordered a movement command.
The amount of time it takes for
Kayn
to
attach
to his target is between 0.
5
seconds (cast from max range, not as
Shadow Assassin
) and 0.
25
seconds (cast from point blank range).
This duration is fixed, meaning
Kayn
will attach regardless of how far away the target gets while he is
dashing
toward them.
If the target
dies
, enters
resurrection
, or is sent to the
Realm of Death
while
Kayn
is
attached
, he will instantly detach and reappear on top of the target's location. This does not occur if
Kayn
is in the process of emerging from the target.
If those same conditions occur before the attachment,
Kayn
will reappear at the target's location after completing the dash.
In both of these cases,
Umbral Trespass
will occasionally not go on cooldown.
(bug)
Kayn
will automatically emerge when attached to a
clone
that expires.
If
Kayn
dies while
attached
and the recast is available,
Umbral Trespass'
damage is dealt immediately. If the recast is not available,
Umbral Trespass'
damage is not dealt at all.
Entering
resurrection
while
attached
does not deal
Umbral Trespass'
damage regardless of if the recast is available or not.
Kayn
will detach immediately in both cases.
During
Umbral Trespass
,
Kayn
will not take the self-inflicted damage from
Death's Dance's
Ignore Pain

turret
.
As
Rhaast
,
Umbral Trespass

heal
automatically if the target dies during the channel.
The heal is not granted if the target dies before the channel starts.

Displacements
cannot interrupt the initial dash and neither can they apply while

is attached. If the

source applies a
debuff
,
Kayn
attaches to his target immediately, ending the dash prematurely in the process. The debuff is also removed instantly.
Until the recast or after the duration, the ability will have had no effect on the target for the purposes of
Electrocute
or the 'in-combat' status.
Spell shields
will prevent
Kayn
from infesting the target, but will do nothing to mitigate the recast when used once he has already infested them.
If
Kayn
targets an enemy that is currently being protected by a
spell shield
, the ability will simply go on cooldown without making him infest his target.

A peerless practitioner of lethal shadow magic, Shieda Kayn battles to achieve his true destiny—to one day lead the Order of Shadow into a new era of Ionian supremacy. He wields the sentient darkin weapon Rhaast, undeterred by its creeping corruption of his body and mind. There are only two possible outcomes: either Kayn bends the weapon to his will… or the malevolent blade consumes him completely, paving the way for the destruction of all Runeterra.

As an honored Ordinal of the Demaxian Empire, Kayn relentlessly hounds the crew of the Morning Star, hoping to recapture Sona and learn the secrets of the legendary Ora Gate. He bickers constantly with his sentient alien scythe, Rhaast, whose own motivations are far more dire than Kayn could ever realize…

Rhaast was once an archon of light, a beacon of order… and now he is little more than a weapon in the hands of Kayn, an ambitious demi-god of dusk seeking true godhood. The two war within Kayn's own body, each determined to overthrow the other and lay claim to true divinity.

The communion was nearly complete. Kayn could feel the Blood Moon demon writhing within. It was then that the Snow Moon assassins struck. Stolen away from that temple into theirs, Kayn was inducted into the Snow Moon Order, their ancient ways piercing and unfamiliar. Only time will tell if their taming of his spirit holds.

Kayn wields his music like a weapon—both as himself and as his demonic alter ego, Rhaast. Though he's got all the training of a pop music prince, his bad reputation after the breakup of his last band made him an industry pariah. Determined to spite the haters, Kayn joined HEARTSTEEL only to find creative partners (and friends?) he might actually trust.

Innate:
Kayn
wields an ancient, sentient weapon, that battles with him for control. Dealing damage against champions causes them to drops orbs that are automatically collected upon leaving combat, filling a bar above

Rhaast
or expel him to become the
Shadow Assassin
, based on whether he has damaged more
melee
or
ranged
champions, respectively. Once primed, the other option becomes available after 4 minutes.
The transformation can only be performed by interacting with their portrait while on the summoning platform, permanently changing their abilities.

Trivia

Kayn
is one of 21 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Aatrox
,
Camille
,
Darius
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Draven
,
Garen

Riven
,
Samira
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Urgot
,
Xayah
,
Yone
, and
Zed
.
He is the seventh dark-themed Ionian-
affiliated
champion (albeit Noxian-
born
), after
Shen
,
Varus
,
Syndra
,
Zed
,
Xayah
&
Jhin
; as well as the second-known member from the Order of Shadow.
His given name
Shieda
is pronounced /ˈʃi:da/, and is Ionian in origin.
[4]
By coincidence, his surname
Kayn
resembles:
Biblical
Cain
, from Semitic root
q-y-n
"smith"
[5]
< "spear" < "
reed
"
*qanay
.
[6]
Irish surname
Kane
, Anglicized from Gaelic
Ó Catháin
, from Proto-Celtic
*katus
"fight, battle".
[7]
His stint as a child-soldier references
conscription of children
;
Not all Noxian commanders condone their colleagues' callousness, though they at least turn a blind eye.
While in
Darkin
form, the champion's ability tooltips change to read "Rhaast" instead of "Kayn".
His dance references
the Reebok dance
.
If you are tied in orbs for
The Darkin Scythe
, you will be defaulted to
Rhaast
.
[8]
Although patch
V7.16
made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI, transforming into
Shadow Assassin
or
Rhaast
always uses their base portraits for all skins. (Not true since V13.23)
The Darkin Scythe's
icons upon transformation for
Shadow Assassin
and
Darkin
are both reused for the
Teamfight Tactics
items
Kayn's Liberation
and
Rhaast's Embrace
respectively, which reference him and Rhaast.

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Takedown
Takedown
refers to a
kill
or
assist
being acceptable, with the type of enemy specified in each use case.
Takedown
is associated with triggering a
passive
effect, or timed effects shortly after scoring.

Heal
Healing
replenishes a unit's
current
health
, but never above their
maximum

Incoming heals can trigger bonus effects from
Overheal

Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water

League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Invulnerability
A unit that is
Invulnerable
reduces all damage taken to
0
and prevents effects that trigger from damage.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall
or
Blade Whirl

The following abilities perform one or more
projectile popping events
:
Most
abilities and effects that grant

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's

Samira's
Blade Whirl

Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.

Persistent damage
Persistent damage
is the damage type dealt primarily by damage over time (DoT) abilities. Most sources of
persistent damage

magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
persistent damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown

Unobstructed vision
A unit with
unobstructed sight
can see the full circle of their
vision
radius, ignoring all obstructions and being able to see into terrain. This effect does not allow the user to see into
brush
, although they will be able to see beyond the brush if within range.
Having
unobstructed sight
will benefit all forms of vision, including
true sight
and
camouflage
detection - i.e. you will be able to reveal stealthed units over walls where usually terrain would block true sight.
Nearsight
prevents this vision entirely; the user's sight radius will not infiltrate beyond terrain.
