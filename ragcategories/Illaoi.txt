Prophet of an Elder God
STATIC COOLDOWN
:
20 − 7.
25
(based on level)
EFFECT RADIUS:
1000
Innate:
Periodically, a
Tentacle
will spawn next to nearby
terrain
. It can be killed by enemy basic attacks and will become dormant if
Illaoi
leaves it alone. A
Tentacle
only attacks through
Illaoi's
abilities and does so by slamming the ground once, dealing
physical damage
to enemies hit. Whenever it hits at least one enemy
champion
,
Illaoi
is
healed
for a portion of
her
missing
health
.
Innate:
Periodically,
Illaoi
spawns a
Tentacle
on the nearest terrain perpendicular to her location, if no other Tentacles are already nearby it. Tentacles fully spawn after a 2 second delay and are
untargetable
in the meantime.
Tentacles
are commanded to attack by
Illaoi's
abilities
, dealing
9 − 162 (based on level)
(+ 100% AD)
(+ 40% AP)
physical damage
to all enemies struck, increased by
0% − 30% (based on
Tentacle Smash's rank)
.
Enemies struck by multiple slams within 0.
5
seconds of another, take 50% damage for the second and 25% damage for all other additional slams.
Each
Tentacle
also
heals
Illaoi
for
5% of her
missing
health
if it hits at least one enemy
champion
.

Illaoi
cannot spawn
Tentacles
on ally invulnerable
structures
(note)
, in addition to neither her nor the
Vessel
being able to spawn them in
Nexus Obelisk's
attack range.
Even after
Nexus turrets
have lost their invulnerability,
Illaoi
still has issues spawning
Tentacles
on them (probably because of the nearby invulnerable
Nexus
).
(bug)
Tentacles
will prioritize spawning on map terrain before player-made ones.
If multiple
Tentacles
hit simultaneously, the received healing is calculated iteratively based on the new amount of
missing
health, as per this formula:
(
maximum
health −
current
health)
× (1 − 0.955
n
), with 'n' the number of

hits.

Harsh Lesson
is made of two different abilities which are decided by
Illaoi's
range to the target, being either
melee
or within
dash
range.
The close range ability:
Has an
uncancellable windup
.
Can be used while
grounded
or
rooted
. If
Illaoi
attack commands and then casts
Harsh Lesson
while
rooted
, she is able to use the close range version within its dash range.
(bug)
Starting the attack before triggering
Guardian Angel's
passive and hitting while she's in it will not cause the
Tentacles
to slam.
(bug)
The attack will still hit if the target becomes
untargetable
, but will not if it
dies
.
(note)
Tentacles
will slam if the attack is
blocked
, but not if it's
dodged
or if it
misses
.
(note)
Does trigger
Hail of Blades
.
Triggers
Energized
effects
on-hit
.
If the empowered attack duration ends during the attack animation, the attack won't be empowered.
(note)
After hitting the target,
Illaoi
can quickly cast other abilities.
Abilities cannot be buffered during the windup.
PENDING FOR TEST:
The attack goes through
spell shields
.
The dash range ability:
Does not have an uncancellable windup, meaning effects that can interrupt the dash will cancel the attack and put the ability on cooldown.
Can be cast but cannot be used while
grounded
or
rooted
because
Illaoi
loses the
bonus
attack range
.
The attack will not hit if the target becomes
untargetable
, but does hit if it
dies
.
(note)
Tentacles
will slam if the attack is
dodged
,
blocked
or if it
misses
.
Does not trigger
Hail of Blades

(bug)
Triggers
Energized
effects during the jump.
(bug)
Having enough attack speed will perform an unusual dunk.
(note)
If the empowered attack duration ends during the dash, the buff will linger until the attack has finished.
After hitting the target,
Illaoi
has a short delay before she can cast other abilities.
(note)
Abilities can be buffered during the windup.
The attack goes through
spell shields
, but also triggers them.
(bug)
If the target dies at the instant
Harsh Lesson
is about to hit the target, the attack will hit, be consumed, but will not make the
Tentacles
slam.
(bug)
The
Tentacle
attacking because of
Harsh Lesson
is considered to be of the same
cast instance
, and thus will not grant additional stacks of
Conqueror
,
Electrocute
,
Phase Rush
and
Tribute
.
(note)
Harsh Lesson
triggers
Bone Plating
and one of its plates with the same attack.
(note)
It also triggers
Arcane Comet
and reduces its cooldown twice.
While the ability is active,
Tentacles
are commanded to attack
on-hit
, interacting with
Guinsoo's Rageblade
without consuming the empowered attack.
Attack moving while charging
Hexflash
will delay the attack.

champion
, she rips their
Spirit
out from them to stand before her. The
Spirit
tethers
to the target for a duration, dealing a portion of any damage it takes. If the
Spirit
is killed or the target leaves its range, the target will be
slowed
and marked as a
Vessel
for a duration or until they

Illaoi

Tentacles
while marked.
Tentacles
will autonomously attack the nearest

Illaoi
launches a tendril in the target direction that stops at the first enemy hit, pulling their
Spirit
out in front of
Illaoi
over 0.

seconds if they're a
champion
. The target is
tethered
to the
Spirit
for
7 seconds
,
revealing
them in addition to granting
sight
of the area around them while the tether remains.
The
Spirit
spawns with the target's
current
health
,
armor
and
magic resist
, and redirects a portion of the
pre-mitigation damage
received to the tethered champion.
Damage Transmission:
25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%

When the
Spirit
is killed or the target leaves tether range, the tether is severed, marking the target as a
Vessel

slowing
them by 80% for 1.

Spirits
can only be fully targeted by
Illaoi's
team and neutral monsters. The
Spirit's
allies cannot manually select it as a valid target for spells and abilities, but they can still do so with automatically targeted effects.
(bug)
Spirits
take 50% damage from
turrets
.
(bug)
Spirits
cannot be
healed
nor
shielded
(
Summon Aery
excluded
(bug)
).
The
Spirit
levels up when the
Vessel
does, gaining the target's stats per level. If the target has a resource that also increases per level (i.e
mana
), the
Spirit's
lifetime will increase instead.
(bug)
The
Spirit's
destination is decided based on
Illaoi's
position and facing direction when the target is hit.
The
Spirit
is
untargetable
while it is being pulled, and spawns with the tethered champion's default model and size.
The
Spirit's
lifetime is sometimes 0.
25
seconds longer, while its
untargetability
is sometimes shorter, causing
Tentacles
to hit an inconsistent amount of times.
Redirected damage is calculated by taking the pre-mitigation damage against the
Spirit
, applying
Test of Spirit's
damage modifier, and then capping it to the
Spirit's
current
health
. This damage will then be affected by damage modifiers (resistances and other effects) of the
Vessel
.
This order of operations allows
Test of Spirit
to deal more or less percentage of the
Vessel's
health
than would be expected:
Because the
Spirit's
modifiers can be different from the
Vessel's
, and the damage being pre-mitigated, allowing the
Spirit
to have higher or lower
effective health
, respectively increasing or decreasing the maximum achievable damage from killing it.
Because the cap is supposed to block excess damage over the
Spirit's
current
health
, which does not reliably do so or does too well, depending on whether the
Spirit's
damage modifier is higher than
Test of Spirit's
or not, respectively. This causes an increasing difference of damage when the pre-mitigated damage is between
Spirit current health ÷ Spiritmod
and
Spirit current health ÷ Emod
.
(bug)
To fix this case, pre-mitigated damage would need to be capped at the amount that kills the
Spirit
, and only then have
Test of Spirit's
damage modifier apply.
Illaoi
needs
937.

5
total
AD
to reach 100% redirected damage. As per above, the damage is still dependent on the
Spirit's
and
Vessel's
damage modifiers and may not always be able to deal 100% of the target's
current
health as total redirected damage.
Spell shields
may only prevent the initial spirit grab and the
slow
upon becoming a
Vessel
.
Spell shields
will not prevent becoming a
Vessel
or
Tentacles
from attacking.
The tendril can be blocked by abilities such as
Yasuo's
Wind Wall
, but the returning tether slow cannot, even if it can otherwise be
destroyed
by effects that can do so (i.e
untargetability
).
The tether slow will not be fired if the target is already
untargetable
when the
Spirit
dies.
The spirit pull is not considered a
crowd control
effect and will not be blocked by
crowd control immunity
, with the exception of
Morgana's
Black Shield
.
(note)
The projectile tentacle model is linked to
Illaoi's
model animation and size. However gameplay wise it is not, thus the actual hitbox being different than the position, width and length of the visible model.
(bug)
The model will stop mid-air / vanish if
Illaoi
goes into
stasis
,
sleep
or
airborne
, however the actual hitbox will continue its trajectory unseen.
PENDING FOR TEST:
The projectile is however seen by enemies if
Illaoi
is not
visible
.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
And will fire towards the same pointed location.
Grabbing the
Spirit
of a champion before it goes into
resurrection
via
Chronoshift
or
Guardian Angel
will spawn the
Spirit
with 0 health, making it
invulnerable
.
(bug)
The same does not happen with other
resurrection
effects (i.e
Karthus'
Death Defied
) since they leave the champion with more than 0 health.
Grabbing the
Spirit
of
Viego
will make the
Spirit's
lifetime (the white bar below the lifebar) disappear.
(bug)
PENDING FOR TEST:
Grabbing the
Spirit
of an
Oathsworn
will make the
Spirit
invisible.
(bug)
Illaoi
is the only one able to see who's been
Vesseled
, by adding a layer of watery effects on their model. The
Vessel
will also be let known it's debuffed, by having a layer of watery effects on its screen instead.
If the target becomes a
Vessel
while
vanished
, the layer on their model will fail to be added.
(bug)
The
Vessel
status effect is a debuff that doesn't
persist through death
.
If the target is made a
Vessel
while
resurrecting
, they will not revive as a
Vessel
.
Runes consider the
Spirit
as a champion for their effects and stat-tracking.
(note)
Tentacles
damage with
First Strike
only reflects double bonus damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the
Spirit
(e.g if
First Strike
would deal 3 bonus damage, what would get reflected is 6 damage).
(bug)
Transferred damage will apply on-damage effects, such as
Black Cleaver
,
Morellonomicon
,
Executioner's Calling
,
Riftmaker
,
Aspect of the Dragon
burn damage, and
The Darkin Scythe
.
Redirected damage always counts as single target for the purpose of
Omnivamp
.
Transferred damage will not doubly apply on-hit or on-spell effects versus the target (e.g.
Liandry's Torment
,
Phase Rush
stacks). These effects are only applied versus the
Spirit
.
Attacking the
Vessel
and its
Spirit
simultaneously will only apply one stack of
Black Cleaver
to the
Vessel
.
(note)
When the tether is broken (whether the
Spirit's
lifetime ran out or the target moved out of range), the
Spirit
will
vanish
and move to
Illaoi's
location.
An
uncancellable windup
attack may still kill the
Spirit
after it
vanished
to grant the gold, but without making the target a
Vessel
.
The
Spirit
is immune to
stasis
(i.e.
Bard's
Tempered Fate
).
Fiora's
Riposte
can be used to prevent becoming a
Vessel
if used before the
Spirit
is killed or while leaving the tether's range.
Sion's
Spirit
cannot be spawned during
Glory in Death
.
Spirits
created before
Sion's
zombie state
will remain active.
If the target that had its
Spirit
pulled from them is taken into the
Realm of Death
, the tether will break, but they will not be made into a
Vessel

Tips & Tricks
Other than
area of effects
, since
Riftmaker
,
Aspect of the Dragon
burn damage, and
The Darkin Scythe
apply on the
Spirit
and the
Vessel
individually and as separate instances of damage, their
bonus
damage through the redirection is effectively enhanced. In particular,
Riftmaker
and
The Darkin Scyte
will further apply on their own redirected
bonus
damage.
Note, the same does not apply for damage modifiers without a separate instance of damage (i.e
Last Stand
).
PENDING FOR TEST:
Does the above still apply for
Riftmaker
after its
V12.23

Tentacles
may spawn on base barriers. If
Illaoi
is in the center of a base barrier, all
Tentacles
will spawn in the same position and stack over each other, making it appear as if there was only one
Tentacle
.
Illaoi's
facing direction is decided by the position of the cursor on cast, but can also be changed mid-cast through other effects, such as
Flash
.
If there are no walls nearby, spawning the last
Tentacle
will form a perfect hexagon.
Spell shields
will block the ability's damage but will not prevent
Tentacles
from spawning.
If
Illaoi
dies
within 0.
25
seconds of dropping down, she will spawn buffed
Tentacles
, but she won't manage in time to buff the already spawned ones.
(bug)
If
Illaoi
is near a
Tentacle
that is about to spawn, it will spawn buffed by
Leap of Faith
even if
Illaoi
is no longer nearby.
Using
Harsh Lesson
after
Illaoi
drops down will command
Tentacles
to instantly attack, regardless if they were already attacking. Their old attack will keep on going and will hit while the second attack is on its animation attack.
(bug)
This makes it possible for the same tentacle to reduce its own damage by having the second attack hit too fast, which is not otherwise possible.
Using
Harsh Lesson
an instant before
Leap of Faith's
buff finishes will delay the
Tentacle's
attack.

The

Its attacks get queued up if it receives more than one attack command. The queued attacks will always have 1 attack speed, even if affected by

Illaoi’s powerful physique is dwarfed only by her indomitable faith. As the prophet of the Great Kraken, she uses a huge, golden idol to rip her foes’ spirits from their bodies and shatter their perception of reality. All who challenge the 'Truth Bearer of Nagakabouros' soon discover Illaoi never battles alone—the god of the Serpent Isles fights by her side.

Chief enforcer of the human-led resistance, Illaoi was once the subject of a failed Battlecast conversion that left her with control over nearby machines. Seizing her newfound power, she has single handedly decimated Viktor's forces in countless battles, becoming a beacon of hope for rebels across the world.

Illaoi, the High Priestess of the Snow Moon, imagines a world free of the madness that consumes it. Her vision can only be realized when every soul is cleansed, every demon ripped from its bindings. Maintaining order with an icy resolve, she'll stop at nothing, her own humanity a fleeting memory.

Every Anima Squad recruit knows Illaoi's booming laugh—and her notoriously tough training sessions—all too well. As someone always looking towards the future, it may seem strange that she is also Anima Squad's keeper of the Old Ways. But Illaoi knows that there was life before Final City, and she will ensure life continues long after the war is done.

Mana
Mana
(also known as

League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are

.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp

Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.

Cast instance
Cast instance is the identifier that tells the
source
of spells. Multiple spells, such as basic attacks and abilities, under the same cast instance behave as one for certain interactions. Some notable examples:
Conqueror's
stacking can only be triggered once per cast instance.
Electrocute
and
Phase Rush
can only receive 1 stack for their activation per cast instance.
Muramana
deals its damage once per cast instance.
Not to be confused with damage instance, which is each individual effects, even under the same cast instance.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration

Tenacity
