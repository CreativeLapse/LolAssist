Way of the Hunter
Innate - Intent:
Yone
gains increased
critical strike chance
, but his
critical strikes
deal reduced damage. He also gains
attack damage
from excess
critical strike chance
.
Innate - Steel and Spirit:
Yone's
basic attacks alternate between his
Steel Sword
and
Azakana Sword
. His
Azakana Sword
deals equal parts
physical
and
magic
damage.
Innate - Intent:
Yone's
total
critical strike chance
is doubled from all other sources, but his
critical strikes
deal only

「 90% of the

There is no attack time-out between alternating swords. It will
persist through
death
.
50% of
Spellblade
and
Demolish
damage will be converted to
magic damage
if applied by the
Azakana Sword
.
This will also occur if applied by
Guinsoo's Rageblade's
Phantom Hit
after having last attacked with the
Azakana Sword
.
This will also occur if applied by
Mortal Steel
after having last attacked with the
Azakana Sword
.
(bug)
The mixed damage is dealt in two simultaneous instances of damage, but will pretend to be a single instance for most effects (such as
Conqueror's
stacks).
Both instances deal
basic damage
and thus natively apply
life steal
.
The attack applies
on-hit
effects only once, right at the start.
Even if the target dies from the
magic damage
, the
physical damage
will still be applied to it.
If the target dies from
on-hit
damage, the magic damage portion will be skipped and only the physical damage applied.
(bug)
Yone
requires at least
50% critical strike chance
in order to reach
100% critical strike chance
from
Way of the Hunter's
multiplier.

Mortal Steel
applies
basic damage
for
the first (closest) enemy hit
and
area damage
for secondary enemies:
Mortal Steel
will apply
on-hit
effects to the first target hit, but will not do so to the secondary ones.
Mortal Steel
will not apply
spell effects
to the first target hit, but will do so to the secondary ones.
Spell vamp
will only grant
healing
from the damage dealt to secondary targets, and healing is reduced to 33% effectiveness, accordingly.
Life steal
will heal based on the damage dealt to the first target hit.
Mortal Steel
will not benefit from the bonus attack speed gained by
Hail of Blades
.
(bug)
After a successful crit roll against one of the targets,
Mortal Steel's
thrust is guaranteed to
critically strike
all further targets as well.
(bug)
This is unlike the behaviour of
Yasuo's
Steel Tempest
.
The whirlwind and dash roll their critical strike against each target individually.
Blinking
during
Mortal Steel's
cast with two stacks of
Gathering Storm
(after the cast time) will end the dash prematurely but enemies in range of
Yone
at the new location are affected. The whirlwind's trajectory cannot be changed once it has already been unleashed.
Only the whirlwind can be
intercepted
.
Each parry has different interactions with this ability, whether it's the first target of
Mortal Steel
or the secondary one. In either case
Yone
still gains a stack of
Gathering Storm
and his whirlwind
knock up
cannot be negated by parries:
Dodge
and
Block
: first target
does not
take damage, secondary target
does
take damage.
Blind
: both first target and secondary target take damage.
Spell shield
does not prevent
Yone
from receiving a stack.
Mortal Steel
is disabled while
grounded
or
rooted
if
Yone
has two stacks of
Gathering Storm
.
While at two stacks, a range indicator will be shown for the effective range of the whirlwind.
The
dash
can cross terrain.
If Yone gets knocked back during the 3rd cast, the dash will only damage and knockup around Yone's current position then will stop colliding, making Yone play his 3rd Q end animation while still dashing.
(bug)
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Yone
will always cast
Mortal Steel
in his facing direction, and he will turn to face the target direction at the start of the cast time. While at two stacks,
Yone
will always cast it in the target direction.

Yone

Yone
uses
Flow
as his
resource
to indicate the remaining amount of time in centiseconds (100 centiseconds = 1 second) that
Soul Unbound
can be active for before the ability automatically recasts.
With 1 second remaining before the recast occurs automatically, a soft, dark vignette will pulse over the screen, accompanied by a
distinct audio cue
. This warning is only visible and audible to
Yone
.
Yone's
body unit cannot be interacted with by any means. It will despawn as soon as
Yone's
dash back ends.
Soul Unbound's
recast, even when cast automatically, counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Soul Unbound's
recast does not interrupt
Yone's
last movement or attack order.
Yone
will place himself onto the ground and interrupt
displacements
affecting him upon recasting.
Soul Unbound's
recast is notable for being an ability that
removes
crowd control
but cannot be activated while unable to cast abilities or mobility spells due to the same crowd control.
Soul Unbound
does
not

Soul Unbound's
recast is disabled (cannot be manually nor automatically cast) while
Yone
is in the
Realm of Death
or
The Hextech Ultimatum
. The recast will be deferred until those effects end.
The Hextech Ultimatum
will specifically end if
Yone
recasts
Soul Unbound
.
If
Yone
uses
Mortal Steel
at two
Gathering Storm
stacks to delay
Soul Unbound's
automatic recast, he will be able to basic attack once in a short time period before the automatic recast triggers.
If
Yone
dies
or enters
resurrection
with
Spirit Form
, he will immediately initiate the recast and dash back to his body while dead or resurrecting.
If he dies during the recast, the dash back is not interrupted.
His death animation will play upon arriving to his body.
The marks do not store damage from
items
,
runes
and
summoner spells
.
The mark also automatically detonates without
Yone
having to recast when the marked champion dies or enters
resurrection
.
The detonation damage cannot be dodged by becoming
untargetable
.
The marks will not store damage dealt to
shields
.
If the mark's damage is higher than the target's
current
health, the mark indicator will have a slightly different appearance.
This does not take into account effects that would amplify the damage of the mark, such as
Coup de Grace

In life, he was Yone—half-brother of Yasuo, and renowned student of his village's sword school. But upon his death at the hands of his brother, he found himself hunted by a malevolent entity of the spirit realm, and was forced to slay it with its own sword. Now, cursed to wear its demonic mask upon his face, Yone tirelessly hunts all such creatures in order to understand what he has become.

Long ago, two brothers fought a bitter war across Ionia. Yone, the older brother, was a warlord renowned for his adherence to honor and duty. He fought to defend the country against those who would break its rites and rituals - until he was forced to confront his own brother for his crimes. Both were fated to fall in their final duel… a lesson, perhaps, in pride and hubris.

Yone is a brooding, quiet member of the Assassin Club, one whose morose and serious attitude belies the colossal chip on his shoulder. The bad blood between him and his brother is well known, and even speaking about it casually has been known to invoke Yone's fury—something Caitlyn has picked up on for her own purposes.

Prophecy dictates that the gods will destroy each other, ushering in the end of creation itself— but Yone is determined to defy fate. A half-mortal, half-god born of the clash between chaos and order, Yone wields the power of both night and dawn. He must rally his brethren, bring peace to the gods… or they will all perish.

Yone is nervous. As a DJ he's calm, focused, and improvisational, but Ocean Song is his first concert as a DJ and lyricist. After finding his secret stash of lyrics, his friend Nidalee volunteered to belt them out herself when he refused. He may not be ready to sing, but they'll still hear his voice.

Two brothers lost their home and became Inkshadow Warriors. One gave up his freedom, and the other his identity. Yone paid a steep price for his tattoo: no one remembers that he existed. Now known only as a faceless stranger called the “Man of Masks,” he shields refugees from the Cabal until they can be delivered into Yasuo's protection.

Once a legendary DJ/producer, Yone grew disillusioned with the music industry and mysteriously dropped off the grid, leaving fans and critics alike wanting more. Meeting the other members of HEARTSTEEL pulled him out of his creative funk, and with his passion for music now reignited, Yone is determined to take this band straight to the top.

It'd be a shame to hide behind a computer when you look this cool.

The haunted man doesn't breathe, just leans against the hitching post and squints into the frontier dusk—but it ain't him. Not really. The real Yone is shadow and gunsmoke, roiling as it sinks back into the stillness of his corporeal form. “How'd you wind up split like that?” the young Powder Witch asks. Yone sighs, “It's a long story, kid.”

Yone was first confirmed to be the next champion with
Spirit Blossom Thresh's
voice lines.
On
VPBE
during the
V11.24
cycle
[2]
, a new feature was added where whenever Yone scored a pentakill, a dramatic scene of him performing his
Toggle
emote
was played for 7 seconds.
[3]
This was later removed due to controversy.
[4]
During this time, Yone would become unable to act and negate all incoming damage and debuffs.
[5]
After the scene ended, his abilities' cooldowns would reset after 1 second.
[6]
Fate Sealed
is based on an earlier exploration of
Yasuo's
ultimate ability.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.
Examples
Akali
Evelynn
Zed

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Flow
Flow
is a resource that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
that exists in some quantity beforehand. It is represented beneath the
health bar
that is
blue
until filled, and then
white
. Unlike
Fury
and its variants, however,
Flow
is not affected by the unit's
combat status
. With only one example of
Flow
, the validity of this exception may be called into question in the future.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Mortal Steel
STATIC CD:
4 − 1.
33
(based on
bonus
attack speed)
Active:
Yone
thrusts his
Steel Sword
in a line in the target direction that deals
physical damage
to enemies hit and applies
on-hit
and
on-attack
effects to the first enemy hit. This can
critically strike
.
If this hits an enemy,
Yone
generates a stack of
Gathering Storm
for a few seconds. At 2 stacks, the next
Mortal Steel
consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect.
Gathering Storm Bonus:
Yone
dashes
in the target direction and unleashes a whirlwind in the same direction, both deal
physical damage
and briefly
knocks up
enemies hit.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing
, and
Quicksilver
, remove the
airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Disarm
Flee
Sleep
Stasis
Stun
(
Suspension
)
Suppression
Note that
Berserk
and
Taunt
do not fall under this category because they do not disable attacking altogether; they only inhibit attack commands from being followed.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage

Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.

Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing

Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's
Unbreakable

Samira's
Blade Whirl
, and
Yasuo's
Wind Wall
can block, destroy and / or stop projectiles.
Some
ranged
basic attacks (
including
turrets
) and abilities don't use projectiles and will bypass projectile-blocking effects.
Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.
League of Legends content
Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil

League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge

Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge

Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks

Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
