Handshake's
interaction between its tether and root:
If the root is not applied, neither is the tether.
The tether's duration lasts the same as the root duration, even if it is modified by
tenacity
.
If the root is removed, the tether is as well, but not vice versa.
Spell shield
will block the hook but not the recast's effects as the primary target.
As a secondary target, the recast's effects will be blocked.
Renata
may still move while the hook is in flight.
Her facing direction is locked towards the target direction of the hook.
While the target is hooked,
Renata's
facing direction is considered to be in their direction and not in the one she is moving.
The
movement speed
reduction stacks additively with other
movement speed
bonuses.
It is a negative bonus, not a
slow
, and is thus not reduced by
slow resist
.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

Bailout's
duration resets whenever the target scores a
takedown
against an enemy champion. If the target would
die
while
Bailout
is active, their health is set back to full but they suffer a
true damage
burn that would kill them over a short time. The target can stop the burn by scoring a
takedown
.
Active:
Renata
infuses herself or the target allied champion with a chemtech formula for 5 seconds, granting the target
bonus
attack speed
and
bonus
movement speed
while they are facing nearby
visible
enemy champions or minions, with both of the bonuses increasing in effectiveness by
0% − 100% (based on seconds elapsed)

If the target takes
fatal damage
while
Bailout
is active, they are restored to
100% of their
maximum
health
but suffer a
true damage
burn equal to
10% of their
maximum
health
every
0.

seconds
until they die from reaching 0 health, during which
Bailout's
duration is reset every 0.
25
seconds. This effect may occur only
once
per application of
Bailout
while the target already has the buff and is not burning.
The burn will stop once the target scores a
takedown
against an enemy champion within 6 seconds of damaging them, setting their
current
health
to
20% of their
maximum
health
immediately afterwards.

Info

Unit
Damage taken in excess of the fatal damage taken does not apply to the target's health after it was restored.
The self-damage taken is considered
raw damage
and is calculated based on the target's
maximum
health at the time of taking lethal damage.
Bailout's
bonuses will not reset in effectiveness if its duration is refreshed.
Bailout
takes priority over all
resurrection
and
zombie state
effects.
Bailout
will stop refreshing its duration while the target is burning after 250 seconds have elapsed.
Bailout
cannot be used on
clones
nor
zombie state
units.
If the target takes fatal damage during
Bailout
, upon destroying a turret while being targeted by it, they will receive their own
bonus shut-down bounty
(ignoring the base kill reward of 300 gold) instead of being executed.

Renata Glasc rose from the ashes of her childhood home with nothing but her name and her parents’ alchemical research. In the decades since, she has become Zaun’s wealthiest chem-baron, a business magnate who built her power by tying everyone’s interests to her own. Work with her, and be rewarded beyond measure. Work against her, and live to regret it. But everyone comes to her side, eventually.

Ambitious, cunning, cutthroat – these qualities served Admiral Glasc well during the Galactic Civil War. They serve her still, both on the front lines and in the weapons manufacturing industry. As leader of the Royal Space Military's R&D unit, Admiral Glasc will bring order to the galaxy with a firepower unmatched: whether it's dropping planetside or traversing distant stars, the universe is her chessboard, and she is the queen.

In a life filled with forced relationships, death freed Renata to form the family she always wanted. As the Enterprise Family's founder, the bond between members doesn't come from any sense of familial warmth but from honest calculation. As for her work, Renata looks at society and pulls whatever deathly strings she needs to make things more “efficient.”

From fashion model to maven, Renata owns one of the largest fashion houses showing at the Gala. After all this time, enough critics have declared her "death" after a poor show that she wears the label proudly, invigorating the spirit of her company and makeshift family. In the end, only she controls the threads of life and death, on the runway at least.

Enchanter
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Enchanters
focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support

mana regeneration

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Enchantment redirection
A certain group of damaging abilities called
enchantments
or
empowerments
require interaction of an
empowerer
, with an
ally
hitting an enemy. Enchantments commonly include mark detonations or
buffs
given to allies. The credit for an applied enchantment is directed in the following ways:
Any damage dealt through the ally by the enchantment is credited to the empowerer instead of the ally. Effects that can trigger on-damage instances of the empowerer (e.g.
Summon Aery
;
Morellonomicon's
Grievous Wounds
on magic damage; etc.) will trigger and also be credited to the empowerer. For the empowerer's redirected damage only, the ally will apply the empowerer's damage modifiers (e.g.
magic penetration
).
Any unit
kill
achieved by the ally having applied the empowerer's redirected damage, is credited to the ally instead of the empowerer.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage

heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage

Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp

Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver

Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage

Tenacity
Tenacity
(or
Crowd Control Reduction
) is a stat that reduces the duration of all incoming
crowd control
effects except
displacements
,
drowsy
,
nearsight
,
stasis
, and
suppression
.
If
tenacity
is reduced below 0, the crowd control duration increases.
Tenacity
stacks
multiplicatively
or
additively
based on the combination of effects.
The duration of a crowd control debuff is calculated when it is applied, and
tenacity
can reduce it to a minimum 0.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Raw damage
Raw damage
is a type of damage that normally ignores resistances,
shields
, and
minimum health threshold
and
resurrection
effects on the target.
Invulnerability
and
spell shields
,  where applicable, are the only ways to reduce or negate
raw damage
. Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against an enemy always deal more than
100% of the target's
current
health
(
"execution damage"
). Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against the player's own champion or an ally are special-cased to take place during effects that protect champions from death. Current implementations of
minimum health thresholds
are special-cased to leave units at
1 health
rather than the threshold, when they are dealt lethal
raw damage
.
Raw damage
does not interact with
any
effect.
Internal raw
damage is a form of
raw damage
that also bypasses
invulnerability
and has no overrides in place to prevent it from killing death-protected champions. The
Nexus Obelisk
,
Zac's
Cell Division
redirected damage, and
Rift Herald's
self-damage also have this modified form.
League of Legends content
Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects. Entering
resurrection
does not cancel cast times.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.
League of Legends content
Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion
after
Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
. It prevents enemies from gaining full kill credit or triggering most on-kill effects from the champion a second time, and some abilities (e.g.
You and Me!
) interact differently with champions in this state.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout

Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state

Clone
A
clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of

champion
, copying their current vitality, stats, items, level, and most status effects upon creation. They are considered champions against many effects that do not strictly require
player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.
The
damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a

Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of

shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash

shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
