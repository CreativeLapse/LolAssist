If exceptionally close to terrain, the bubble will pass through without detection and will still be able to pass through a second piece of terrain - although it sacrifices any range its already used going through the first piece.
Sleepy Trouble Bubble
can interact with
player-generated terrain
.
At the end of the path of the initial missile, before continuing with the short bounce,
Sleepy Trouble Bubble
checks for targets in a
100 radius to immediately collide with.
This "lollipop" is one of only a few that is larger than the ability's missile width.
Sleepy Trouble Bubble
can still be collided with during the short bounce between end of initial missile and the trap being formed.
This seems to use a
very small or negative collision radius, rather than normal missile collision.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
The missile's maximum range location, or end position, is determined at the start of the cast and as such will always be fired to the same spot regardless of where
Zoe
is at the end of the cast time.
An applicable example of this can be seen in an interaction with her
Portal Jump
. If
Sleepy Trouble Bubble
is cast right before she blinks back to
Portal Jump's
original cast position, the range of the missile will be extended for it to fire to the same end position as if she had not blinked back. This interaction occurs in this manner due to the missile's behavior as explained prior and the fact that
Zoe
blinks back with
Portal Jump
before the cast time of
Sleepy Trouble Bubble
finishes, causing the cast time to finish from
Portal Jump's
original cast position.

As the embodiment of mischief, imagination, and change, Zoe acts as the cosmic messenger of Targon, heralding major events that reshape worlds. Her mere presence warps the arcane mathematics governing realities, sometimes causing cataclysms without conscious effort or malice. This perhaps explains the breezy nonchalance with which Zoe approaches her duties, giving her plenty of time to focus on playing games, tricking mortals, or otherwise amusing herself. An encounter with Zoe can be joyous and life affirming, but it is always more than it appears and often extremely dangerous.

Polaris considered the three leaders' wishes, and with a wave of her hand, conjured the Aurora into two shapes: a sinewy mass of teeth and fur, and a tireless, smiling soldier.

]
She is the first
heterochromic
champion (not counting
Bittersweet Lulu
). This trait is preserved in all of her skins.
In
Ancient Greek
,
Zoe
Ζωή (
IPA
: [zdɔː.ɛ̌ː] > [zo'i]) means "life", as opposed to "death";
[2]
while its
cognate
βῐ́ο(το)ς
bio(to)s
means "lifetime" or "the living's world".
[3]
Upon jumping out of
Portal Jump's
second portal, Zoe licks the ice cream cone, which she attempts to eat during her joke animation (Ctrl+1).
Zoe
has multiple walk cycles that change randomly over the course of the game, but players can also toggle the next one using the
Toggle
key bind (default [Ctrl] + [5]).
During her champion sneak peek video,
AstroNautilus
and
Astronaut Teemo
make cameos:
AstroNautilus
appears when Zoe is showing some of her dance moves.
Astronaut Teemo
shows up when Zoe falls through a portal and
Cyber Pop Zoe
comes out of it.
At the end of her sneak peek video, Zoe is listening to
Kinetic (The Crystal Method x Dada Life)
, one of
DJ Sona's
music tracks.
Her title, as found on the store, "Zoe, The Aspect of Twilight" is one of the few occurrences, along with
Kayn
,
Taliyah
,
Aurelion Sol
,
Illaoi
,
Elise
,
Sion
, of having the word "the" capitalized, compared to all other champions' titles.
Zoe has a cameo in the action role-playing game,
CrossCode
.
[4]
Zoe's Series 1
Eternals
make the following references:
Finders Keepers
references the idiom
finders keepers, losers weepers
.
Paddle Ball Champion
references the sport of
paddle ball
and its similarites to
Paddle Star

Burst
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Burst Mages
aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current

Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range

Projectile
A
projectile

is any entity not classified as a unit (

Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
