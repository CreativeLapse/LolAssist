The initial cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Deactivating the ability manually does not.
The cask ignores unit and terrain collision therefore it will only stop once it reaches the target location.
On arrival the cask will begin to glow ever brighter as it ferments until it turns bright red.
Barrel Roll
has an internal cooldown while traveling so that
Gragas
may only make it explode on arrival.
The charge-up countdown will only start once the cask stops rolling.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

Equal parts jolly and imposing, Gragas is a massive, rowdy brewmaster on his own quest for the perfect pint of ale. Hailing from parts unknown, he now searches for rare ingredients among the unblemished wastes of the Freljord, trying each recipe as he goes. Often intoxicated and extremely impulsive, he is legendary for the brawls he starts, which often end in all-night parties and widespread property damage. Any appearance from Gragas must surely foreshadow drinking and destruction—in that order.

Some might say Gragas would be the perfect Santa, and between his jolly frame and wild beard he certainly fits the bill. But Gragas is also very unreliable, constantly intoxicated, and starts fights seemingly at random—but he likes the costume, and no one is brave enough to take it back.

Gragas Caskbreaker is described in legend as both a pious, sun-worshipping cleric and a despicable drunk, depending on who tells the tale. He's not too familiar with Riftquest, but he does like fighting dragons and passing out in the middle of his combat actions.

A large man even before donning his hermetically sealed arctic combat suit, Gragas is a mystery to all save for High Command's secretive R&D labs. He appears human by all measures, save for the mask he never removes, and the eerily cold mixture of chemicals powering his massive frame.

The Wardens are a sect of those who choose to don the armor of the Protectorate. Wardens hail from all corners of the world; so long as one holds fast to one's pledge, then one is a Warden. Gragas found purpose in this calling, and found camaraderie in his fellow Wardens, who welcomed him—all of him—with open arms.

No angel nor devil, but something else. “Won't be easy, friend. Hell, you may not even stay in one piece. But listen close, and you just might make it back to the living.”

Gragas used to be the only
Mage

Fighter
champion as well as the only melee mage.
He is now a
Fighter
/
Mage
so until recently there have been no melee mages, with
Sylas
now taking up that role. (even though most champions with the Mage secondary role are melee).
His first title was 'the Cask Master' but was changed to avoid confusion with
the Card Master
.
What appears to be Gragas' cask can be seen in the game's Mac Version trailer.
Gragas is the third champion to have 9 skins, behind

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

acquisition range

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt

Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement

summoner spells

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
