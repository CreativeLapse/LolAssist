Innate:
Graves'
basic attacks consume up to
2 shells
before needing to reload. The reload speed is reduced based on his
bonus
attack speed
. Each attack fires several
pellets
in a cone that each collide with the first enemy hit. Hitting a target with multiple
pellets
will deal increased damage, and non-champion enemies are additionally
knocked back
.
Innate - Double Barrel:
Graves'
basic attacks
fire his shotgun to consume
ammunition
within
2 shells
. He will
reload
over a few seconds immediately after expending all shells or withholding leftover shells for a while. The reload time is reduced by

[2]
Attack speed
Growth
will always have a positive effect on your reload speed and is not counted toward the 150% and 200% attack speed thresholds. For example, Graves gains
51% bonus Attack Speed
from Growth at level 18; meaning the thresholds at level 18 are at 201% and 251% respectively.
Maximum Reload Speed:

Graves'
attack windup
is based on such a low value that it will always take only
1 game tick
, even at the lowest possible
attack speed
(
0.2AS
).
When
Graves'
has his range increased by 35% to
573.
75
via
Rapid Firecannon
, it has special effects on his cone spread:
The reach of the individual missiles is also increased by 35% to
843.

/

The spread of the individual missiles is

.
Graves has a standard ranged homing missile used against
Wards
and
Jungle plants
. Pellets will not hit these targets.
This is also used for
Energized
The effect is therefore guaranteed to affect his attack target, even if the pellets are connecting with a different target.
The missile is reminiscent of the more standard ranged attack of pre-rework
Graves
.
If
Graves
is
blinded
pellets will fly (still in a cone) in a random direction (excluding his target's) but he can still damage nearby enemy units hit by pellets.
Structures can be hit by multiple pellets, as with other valid targets.
If a
critical strike
occurs on a target behind the structure and the structure is hit by all pellets, this increases damage to the structure by 33.
3
%.
"Single-use" on-hit effects (e.g.
Spellblade
) will be applied to the first enemy hit; the closest one.
On-Action Effects
such as
Help, Pix!
and
Runaan's Hurricane
will be triggered, and still obey their standard target-acquisition rules.
Wind's Fury
can select secondary targets that will also be damaged by collision from
Graves'
attack.
Each pellet hit applies
Black Cleaver
, allowing you to stack up to 4/6 stacks per shot.
Randuin's Omen
reduces the critical damage of all pellets, resulting in each pellet dealing less damage when crit than if it wasn't critting (You still get 6 pellets which deal slightly more damage overall)
Shooting a champion with
Sundered Sky
causes a guaranteed crit. If no pellet connects with that champion, you won't consume the mark (and won't heal).
Kraken Slayer
will only stack once, even if multiple enemies are hit.
Kraken Slayer's
projectile appears to go to the selected target, but instead it behaves like a normal pellet, stopping at the first enemy (Visual bug).
The in-game HUD displays
Graves'
"Reload Speed" for reloading 2 Shells instead of his Attack Speed. This is a visual bug, and his attack speed behaves normally. This value represents
Reloads per Second

Malcolm Graves is a renowned mercenary, gambler, and thief—a wanted man in every city and empire he has visited. Even though he has an explosive temper, he possesses a strict sense of criminal honor, often enforced at the business end of his double-barreled shotgun Destiny. In recent years, he has reconciled a troubled partnership with Twisted Fate, and together they have prospered once more in the turmoil of Bilgewater’s criminal underbelly.

Graves is a salty ex-soldier who served in the Durandal military before he reluctantly became a professor. Following his discovery of something deep behind enemy lines, he received an offer to teach at the Academy from the God-Weapon itself. His hallmark cigar-munching, dispassionate teaching etiquette is a small price to pay for his decades of experience.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP

stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's

Current

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing

airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Applies life steal
"Applies life steal"
is a
damage tag
that gives an ability the property of having a damage source apply
life steal
like
basic attack damage
would.
This tag is located on some abilities that deal
spell damage
(e.g.
Samira's
Flair
and
Inferno Trigger
) and
items
that deal damage
on-hit
.
Life steal
does not have a penalty for
area of effect
abilities and is always applied to the damage dealt at 100% effectiveness, unless otherwise specified. Unlike
Vamp
, the
"applies life steal"
tag applies life steal directly and does not
heal
based on damage dealt and the life steal
stat
. Therefore healing modifiers that affect
life steal
also affect abilities with the
"applies life steal"
tag.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Ward
Wards
are deployable units that that grant
sight
over the surrounding area. They can only be destroyed by
basic attacks

There are three kinds of deployable
wards
available for purchase:
Control Ward
,
Warding Totem
, and
Farsight Alteration

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver

League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity

Nearsight
A unit that is
nearsighted
has their
sight
radius reduced and
cannot
see beyond their sight radius.
While nearsighted, units cannot reveal
stealthed
wards
or
traps
. Nearsighted units lose vision of all their allies as well as all external sources of vision (including from wards or abilities). This prevents
unit-targeted
effects, including
basic attacks
, from being used outside of the unit's reduced sight radius.
True sight
and
unobstructed vision
do
not
bypass the vision blocked by
nearsight
.
Sources of
nearsight
do
not
stack with each other; only the application with the greatest sight reduction will take effect.
Interrupts:
Interrupts target commands if the
nearsighted
unit's target is outside of their new vision area and prevents
automated target acquisition
.
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
with the exceptions of

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Cc-Immune
Crowd control immunity
prevents
any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic
monsters
(excluding a summoned
Rift Herald
) and
turrets
are always immune to all crowd control, with the exception of
stasis
.
League of Legends content
Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.
"
Cleanse
" does not always refer to the act of removing
all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.
A
cleanse
does not remove
Stasis

Airborne

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets
