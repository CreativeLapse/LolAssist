Details
Jaws of the Beast
deals
basic damage
, but also triggers spell effects by dealing an additional 0
spell damage
.
Jaws of the Beast
has a
0.
264
seconds
cast
delay
, which is the amount of time required for the bite to occur from the start of the cast. This should not be confused with a
cast
time
.
If the cast started beforehand, both the damage and the heal occur even after
Warwick's
death
, or during
resurrection
.
If the target dies prior to
Warwick
reaching them,
Jaws of the Beast
refunds its cooldown when tapped. The ability can be still held, however,
Warwick
is no longer eligible for the refund in this case.
Correction:
The refund can occasionally fail.
(bug)
The healing is calculated only from
Jaws of the Beast's
damage, while additional effects, such as on-hits, are not.
While the bite always occurs after the same delay, the time spent lunging does not, which depends on the range
Jaws of the Beast
was cast away from the target, up to 0.
5
seconds when cast at maximum range.
This does not affect the
lockout
timer, which is the same as the bite's delay.
The lunge always places
Warwick
to his attack range to the center of his target, while the dash will place him up to the edge of his attack range from the target's edge.
It has been special cased so
Warwick
does not follow an enemy's
Recall
or a
Sion
that revives from
Glory in Death
.
Correction:
This may occasionally fail. Also note that as of currently, if
Warwick
manages to bite the target in those conditions, he will almost always end up following them to their base.
(bug)
Jaws of the Beast's
channel cannot be initiated while
grounded
or
rooted
.
Warwick
can only use the normal cast.
The channel will
not
be interrupted by either of the two effects, despite the lock-on being a
movement channel
.
Interactions & Other
In order to hit the cap, the target monster needs to have at least
2500 / 2358 / 2250 / 2167 / 2100 health
.
Jaws of the Beast
is the only ability in the game that combines
channeling
with
displacement immunity
. Every
interrupting
crowd control effect that is not resisted by the displacement immunity will prematurely stop the
dash
.
The bite can still occur if cast before the crowd control application, but
Warwick
cannot start channeling.
Abilities that apply both
stun
and
airborne
at the same time cause
Warwick
to ignore the displacement, but prematurely stop the channel and the dash.
The only exception to this is
Sion's
Glory in Death
.
Warwick
will follow enemies that move via
attachment
effects but the lock-on will
not
be extended.
While
Jaws of the Beast
does not use Quick Casting by default, click-and-hold is comparable to the input required to use
Bone Skewer
or
Comet Spear
. It does not accept two-click input (e.g. First Cast and Recast) that abilities like
Piercing Arrow
or
Decimating Smash
use in Standard Casting.
Warwick
will attempt to basic attack the target after a short delay.

If
Blood Hunt
was cast with no enemy champions within range, the ability incurs its cast time then goes on cooldown without marking any target.
As mentioned by the description,
Blood Hunt
only marks enemy champions if they are damaged below the thresholds by an allied source. This includes
Warwick
himself, champions,
minions
, and
turrets
.
The only exception is the allied
Nexus Obelisk
, because that deals
internalraw
damage, which does not trigger damage-related events such as
Blood Hunt's
marking.
Note that
monsters
are neutral units.
Blood Hunt
can detect and target
decoys
.
Blood Hunt
will occur from wherever
Warwick
was at the start of the cast time.
Blood Hunt
has an indicator that appears above the target(s) when they are being hunted. Some skins have a unique indicator.

Correction:
It should be noted that as of right now, skins that use the

Warwick is a monster who hunts the gray alleys of Zaun. Transformed by agonizing experiments, his body is fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with alchemical rage. Bursting out of the shadows, he preys upon those criminals who terrorize the city’s depths. Warwick is drawn to blood, and driven mad by its scent. None who spill it can escape him.

Gifted to the Lunar Empress when she was a child, Warwick was raised alongside her to guard the immortal realm from an encroaching darkness. More beastly and feral than his companion Nasus, Warwick stands watch in the south, relentlessly pursuing foes to the ends of the world.

Plucked from the wastelands by a PROJECT research cell, Warwick has been irrevocably transformed into a horrifying new stage of transhuman evolution—a weaponized monster stripped of all remorse, and programmed solely for violent suppression. Through the meddling of the ragtag outsiders, he escaped before being completed, and now rampages indiscriminately across the City.

Once known as Father Wolf, Warwick roamed the wood and reveled in moonlight's bloody hunt. The Eclipse Order thought to slay him in his den and end his barbarity—but death means nothing to Old Gods, and he did not stay down. Father Wolf howls into the night once more, now slavering for the taste of human flesh.

The Beast Warwick sniffed his newborn sibling, the Automaton Shaco, as his maker beckoned the leaders to accept their gifts. The Hunter claimed the Beast as his prize, but the prospect of sharing so disgusted the Sage and Warden that chaos quickly erupted over who deserved what. All the while Warwick focused on Polaris, who watched with a wry smile.

Many in Zaun mourned Vander, even as the undercity fell deeper into corruption. No one could have ever known that he still lived, his shimmer-twisted body hidden deep within Singed's lab. Revived as a tormented beast of primal rage, the monster Warwick was unleashed on the world. But if a fragment of his humanity still lives... can Vander be saved?

V11.20
Eternal Hunger
Bug Fix:
No longer heals from attacking wards, trinkets, or champion-generated objects.
Correction:
This mechanic was never observed before, however, note that a possible explanation is that the damage of on-hit effects are reduced to 0 against these types of units, meaning that
Eternal Hunger's
damage-based healing was practically 0 too. The fix might have removed the mechanical trigger of the healing, ultimately not changing the practical result.

Warwick, the Blood Hunter
Warwick's dance references
Thriller
by
Michael Jackson
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Warwick was the second champion to have his
Influence Point
price reduced twice (the others being
Garen
and
Miss Fortune
).
Warwick shares a name with a
town in England
, where it means "abode by the weir".
However, the town's name is pronounced with the second w being silent.
His ability icons depicted him in his
Grey
skin's color scheme rather than his
Original
skin's.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
icon of
Hunter's Call
was used to represent the "Announcements" section.
Warwick, the Uncaged Wrath of Zaun
Following his
rework
, Warwick retains his dance reference to Thriller by Michael Jackson.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
He shares this dance with
Zombie Brand
.
Warwick is displayed when typing 'Urf' in Champion Select.
This is a reference to his
Urf the Manatee
skin (see more details in the "Relations" section below). However, as of his current rework, recent origins behind the skin is unknown.
Warwick,
Vayne
and
Trundle
are the only champions without damaging area-of-effect abilities.

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Heal
Healing
replenishes a unit's
current
health
, but never above their
maximum
health
.
Incoming heals can trigger bonus effects from
Overheal
. Outgoing heals can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Powder Keg
RECHARGE:
17 / 16 / 15 / 14 / 13
Active:
Gangplank
places a
Powder Keg
at the target location, which can be basic attacked or
shot
to damage it. If an enemy destroys a
Powder Keg
, it is safely dismantled.
If
Gangplank
destroys a
Powder Keg
, it will explode to deal the
attack's damage
to nearby enemies and
slow
them. Against an enemy
champion
, the explosion additionally deals
bonus
physical damage
and ignores a
portion of their armor
.
The explosion will cause nearby
Powder Kegs
to also explode.
Gangplank
stocks a
Powder Keg
every few seconds, up to a maximum.

Prophet of an Elder God
STATIC CD:
20 − 7.
25
(based on level)
Innate:
Periodically, a
Tentacle
will spawn next to nearby
terrain
. It can be killed by enemy basic attacks and will become dormant if
Illaoi
leaves it alone.
A
Tentacle
only attacks through
Illaoi's
abilities and does so by slamming the ground once, dealing
physical damage
to enemies hit. Whenever it hits at least one enemy
champion
,
Illaoi
is
healed
for a portion of
her
missing
health
.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt
)
Silence
(
Disrupt

Polymorph

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Lunge
A
lunge
refers to the movement of a champion
during
an ability's cast animation (
such as short-ranged abilities
) or an empowered attack's animation (
such as empowerments that grant
bonus range
), in order to place the champion in range for a follow-up attack.
Lunge
is a movement distinct from
dashes
, primarily by not triggering effects that would otherwise interact with dashes, such as
Poppy's
Steadfast Presence
.

On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing
, and
Quicksilver
, remove the
airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.

is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.

sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state

Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.

Attached
Attached
refers to the state of a unit whose movement is bound entirely to another object, such as a unit or missile. They will be at the current location of the unit they are attached to at all times, or at a specific offset to that location.
A unit can either attach themselves to another unit or attach another unit to themselves. In any case, the unit that has units attached to them can move those units by any means of movement, whether it be by pathing (movement commands), displacement (
dashes
and
forced displacement
), or
blinks
. The unit that is being attached to another unit however cannot move from their current location by themselves by any means, including the use of the aforementioned movement methods.
