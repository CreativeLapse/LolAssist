The mixed damage is dealt in two simultaneous instances of damage, but will pretend to be a single instance for most effects (such as
Conqueror's
stacks).
The
true damage
is dealt in an instance before the
physical damage
.
Both instances deal
basic damage
and thus natively apply
life steal
.
The attack applies
on-hit
effects only once, right at the start.
Even if the target dies from the
true damage
, the
physical damage
will still be applied to it.
If the target dies from
on-hit
damage, the true damage portion will be skipped and only the physical damage applied.
(bug)
Runaan's Hurricane's
Wind's Fury
and
Spellblade
effects have both been special cased to benefit from
Hextech Munitions
, causing their damage dealt to deal

pre-mitigation damage
dealt.

The yordle pilot Corki loves two things above all others: flying, and his glamorous mustache… though not necessarily in that order. After leaving Bandle City, he settled in Piltover and fell in love with the wondrous machines he found there. He dedicated himself to the development of flying contraptions, leading an aerial defense force of seasoned veterans known as the Screaming Yipsnakes. Calm under fire, Corki patrols the skies around his adopted home, and has never encountered a problem that a good missile barrage couldn’t solve.

Commander Corki is both a veteran of the space program and its fearless leader. After traveling to a new and undiscovered planet with his intrepid crew, he befriended a stray alien meep that became his assistant and ally in exploring the galaxy. Together they fly, holding off the encroaching invasion of evil purple meeps that threaten the cosmos.

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
It was speculated that Corki was inspired by
Aurel Vlaicu the Gyrocopter
from
Dota 2
.
This has been proven false given Corki was released on 19-Sep-2009 (patch
V0.9.25.21
) while Gyrocopter was released on 28-Jul-2010 for the original
DotA
custom map.
Yet both of them are most likely based on the
Gyrocopter
from
Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos
(
Frozen Throne
'
s name:
Flying machine
).
Corki was the first
champion
to have two
Legendary
skins
as well as the first and only to have three.
All of them are old skins that are either Legacy or were never for sale to begin with.
Corki's dance references the
"Do a barrel roll!"
phrase spoken by
Peppy Hare
in
Star Fox 64
.
[2]
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
original icon of
Missile Barrage
was used to represent the "In-Game HUD Discussion" section.
The
old sound effect
for when Corki picks up
The Package
was similar to an
air raid siren
, which was pointed out by a player in Syria.
[3]
It was promptly changed.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are

League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge

Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks

skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed

Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below

movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
