Death Defied
Innate:
Upon
dying
,
Karthus
enters an
untargetable
spirit form
for a few seconds that allows him to continue casting spells at no cost but without being able to move. If
Defile
has been learned, it will remain toggled on for
Death Defied's
entire duration.
Innate:
Upon taking
fatal damage
,
Karthus
enters a
zombie state
for 7 seconds, during which he can cast his abilities at no cost. If
Defile
has been learned, it will remain toggled on for
Death Defied's
entire duration.
Requiem
becomes disabled after
Death Defied
has lasted 4 seconds.
While under this state,
Karthus
becomes
untargetable
and
immune to crowd control
as well as prevents all incoming damage, but is also rendered unable to move, declare
basic attacks
, use
summoner spells
, and
activate items

At the start of
Death Defied
,
Karthus
is set to
1 health
.
Karthus
can still regenerate his health over the duration, but he will always die at the end of it.
After
Death Defied
ends, the corpse of
Karthus
will retain
unit collision
despite being dead on the ground.
Karthus'
mana bar
drains over the duration of
Death Defied
as an indicator of his time remaining in this state.
Zombie states trigger upon taking
lethal damage
.
Raw damage
effects will not prevent zombie states from triggering.
All
resurrection
effects will take precedence over effects that reanimate as a zombie.
A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.
Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.
Those that persist through death, such as
Brand's
Blaze
, will remain.
Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by
Veigar's
Event Horizon
and
Viktor's
Gravity Field
to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.
(bug)
This does not apply when transitioning from one zombie state to another zombie state.

The harbinger of oblivion, Karthus is an undying spirit whose haunting songs are a prelude to the horror of his nightmarish appearance. The living fear the eternity of undeath, but Karthus sees only beauty and purity in its embrace, a perfect union of life and death. When Karthus emerges from the Shadow Isles, it is to bring the joy of death to mortals, an apostle of the unliving.

Karthus was a brilliant scholar once upon a time. But when a disease nearly eradicated his people, he researched forbidden Coven magic, hoping to resurrect his loved ones... with catastrophic consequences. Now, he roams the Elderwood as a decaying creature, spreading his plague throughout the forest and inviting its inhabitants to transcend through death.

Trivia

The name
Karthus
resembles Medieval Latin
Carthusianus
.
Karthus, the Deathsinger
Karthus is
voiced
by
Adam Harrington
, who also voices
Kassadin
,
Mordekaiser
,
Ryze, the Rogue Mage
, and
Shaco
.
During development he was called
Lich
.
Requiem
was likely named after
Requiem Mass
referencing Karthus' singing for/about the dead.
His
Chinese Classic splash art
made a
cameo
in
Fright Night
along with
Original Fiddlesticks
.
Karthus, the Deathsinger
A glass case reading
'
Press

can be seen in the game's Mac Version launch trailer.
Before 2016, Karthus had been disabled for every single
Ultra Rapid Fire
edition (most likely to prevent 'Spam
R
to Win' abuse cases).
For a brief time in
Season Five
, Karthus had a bug where he could remain in
Death Defied
indefinitely while alive and held an 87% win rate.

Battlemage
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Battlemages
(also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP

champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap

shop

item actives
can be used while dead.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion
after
Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
. It prevents enemies from gaining full kill credit or triggering most on-kill effects from the champion a second time, and some abilities (e.g.
You and Me!
) interact differently with champions in this state.

Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall

Blade Whirl

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's

Execute
Executes
deal
true damage
equal to
100% of the target's
current
health

source type, ignoring all mitigations.
They do not bypass
invulnerability

League of Legends content
Raw damage
Raw damage
is a type of damage that normally ignores resistances,
shields
, and
minimum health threshold
and
resurrection
effects on the target.
Invulnerability
and
spell shields
,  where applicable, are the only ways to reduce or negate
raw damage
. Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against an enemy always deal more than
100% of the target's
current
health
(
"execution damage"
). Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against the player's own champion or an ally are special-cased to take place during effects that protect champions from death. Current implementations of
minimum health thresholds
are special-cased to leave units at
1 health
rather than the threshold, when they are dealt lethal
raw damage
.
Raw damage
does not interact with
any
effect.
Internal raw
damage is a form of
raw damage
that also bypasses
invulnerability
and has no overrides in place to prevent it from killing death-protected champions. The
Nexus Obelisk
,
Zac's
Cell Division
redirected damage, and
Rift Herald's
self-damage also have this modified form.
League of Legends content
Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
