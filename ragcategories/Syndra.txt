The initial cast does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Detonating the ability manually does.
If the ability is not recast within the duration,
Syndra
will release the unit or
Dark Sphere
that she is holding.
Force of Will
does not destroy in-flight

Teleported
on.
Syndra
can grab
pets
, such as
Shaco's

Casting
Teleport
or
Recall
will cause
Syndra
to cancel
Force of Will
autonomously and drop anything she is holding.
Grabbing prioritizes
Dark Spheres
.
Enemy
pets
that passively have an effect on their surroundings will continue to affect the area around them while they are being held. For example,
Annie's
Tibbers
will continue to inflict burn damage on surrounding units while being held.
Grabbing a
Dark Sphere
will cause the duration on it to refresh, but only on the first cast, not when it is thrown.
Force of Will
has additional effects when targeting the
Blue Sentinel
and
Red Brambleback
. Throwing the former will refund 10
mana
to
Syndra
upon cast and will reduce the
cooldown
of
Force of Will
by 1 second, while throwing the latter will apply the
Crest of Cinders
burn to any affected units in the
area of effect
.
Force of Will's

Scatter the Weak
is blocked by the portion of

Spheres
thrown will stop upon colliding with the wall.
Spheres
spawned at close range of the ability are more likely to be hit.
Enemies and spheres will be knocked into the direction directly away from
Syndra
, and the knock back has no dispersion.
Scatter the Weak
will knock back
Spheres
even farther if they are inside terrain, up until they reach open space. If the terrain they're inside in cannot be surpassed, the
Spheres
will be knocked in the opposite direction.
Scatter the Weak
will delay the expiration of a
Sphere
until after it finishes being knocked back.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Once
Scatter the Weak
has been learned, an arrow directly in front of every

Unleashed Power
makes
Syndra
enter a brief cast time, but the initial cast is completed instantly. If she dies during this cast time,
Unleashed Power
will still complete the remaining effect.
Casting
Unleashed Power
on a target that becomes
untargetable
while the
spheres
are in flight will not destroy them but cause them to deal no damage instead.
Spheres
already in flight will still travel if
Syndra's
target dies, but any remaining
sphere
will not. However, their duration will still get reset.
A
Dark Sphere
summoned very shortly before
Unleashed Power
will
be used as one of the spheres that get thrown.
Depending on how many
spheres
are on the map and how far away the enemy is upon casting
Unleashed Power
it is possible that
Syndra
would conjure the
sphere
behind her as if she was going to throw it, but she won't.
Unleashed Power
will not add a
Sphere
that
Syndra
is holding with
Force of Will
.
Spheres
that are being pushed by

Unleashed Power will grab

Syndra is a fearsome Ionian mage with incredible power at her command. As a child, she disturbed the village elders with her reckless and wild magic. She was sent away to be taught greater control, but eventually discovered her supposed mentor was restraining her abilities. Forming her feelings of betrayal and hurt into dark spheres of energy, Syndra has sworn to destroy all who would try to control her.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Syndra is the first champion to directly manipulate minions and neutral monsters to deal damage to other champions with
Force of Will
. The only other champion to do so is
Sion
with
Sion's
Roar of the Slayer
.
Syndra's spheres appear as red instead of blue when on the opposing team. She is the fourth champion to have team perspective based particles, with the third being
Draven
, the second being
Cassiopeia
and the first being
Singed
.
On her Atlantean and Snow Day skins, they appear purple to enemy instead.
Using
Syndra's
Force of Will
to hit an enemy unit with the
Red Brambleback
will apply the debuff on them. Also, if Syndra throws the
Blue Sentinel
, she will be refunded 10 mana and the ability's cooldown will be lowered by 1 second.
Syndra is the third of the dark-themed Ionian Champions. The first two being
Shen
&
Varus
, followed by
Zed
,
Jhin
,
Xayah
, &
Kayn
.
Syndra's imprisonment under the Dream Pool shares some similarities with the Arthurian lore about
Lady of the Lake
; though Syndra herself is the prisoner, not the jailer.
Syndra's dance references the
choreography
for the song
Hoot
by
Girls' Generation
(소녀시대: So Nyeo Shi Dae), a popular Korean girl group.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Syndra was the third champion to have a difficulty rating of 100, the first being
Cassiopeia
, the second being
Orianna
, and the fourth being
Draven
. However, her difficulty rating has since fallen to 80. On release, her difficulty rating was 90.
Each of Syndra's abilities gain new graphical details when leveled to max rank. For details, see below in her Skin section.
Syndra is the second champion speculated to be
omnipotent
, or nearly so. The first one was Xerath.
As seen in
this video
, Syndra appears to be able to use the balls from another Syndra.
The fact that
Syndra's
Unleashed Power
can use up to seven balls is possibly a reference to the
Dragon Ball
franchise as there are seven Dragon Balls.
Syndra is the second of three dark themed champions to have a light themed skin, with
Varus
being the first and
Aatrox
being the third.
Syndra apparently derives from Proto-Germanic
*
sundr
az
("of/by/for one self"; whence English
sunder
),
[2]
with possible influence from unrelated Greek
συνδρομή
syndrome
.
[3]
Her brother's name,
Evard
, likewise combines two Germanic elements
īhwaz
"
yew
" &
wardaz
"guard".

Burst
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Burst Mages
aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Epic monsters
and
turrets
are special cased to be affected by
stasis
despite them being
crowd control immune
.
Removal:
Cannot be removed by any means (except through
death
), and will prevent the activation of abilities that would usually remove
crowd control
effects.
Quicksilver
will either be placed on a short cooldown, remain usable, or become disabled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
