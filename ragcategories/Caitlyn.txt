Headshot
SPEED:
3000
Innate:
Caitlyn's
basic attacks generate stacks of
Count
. At maximum stacks, her next
basic attack
will fire a
Headshot
dealing
bonus
physical damage
that scales with her
critical strike chance
. On
trapped
or
netted
targets, she gains another
Headshot
at extra
attack range
.
Innate:
Caitlyn's
basic attacks generate a
stack
of
Count
on-attack
, doubled if she is within
brush
. At 5 stacks, or 4 while in
brush
, her next
basic attack
consumes all stacks
on-attack
to become a
Headshot
.
Headshot:
Caitlyn's
basic attack is empowered to have an
uncancellable windup
and deal

Enemies that step over a
Yordle Snap Trap
or are hit by
90 Caliber Net
can grant an additional
Headshot
against them at

within 1.

Headshot
at a time.

If
Caitlyn's
current target becomes trapped by
Yordle Snap Trap
or
90 Caliber Net
while her attack is on cooldown, this ongoing cooldown will be refunded partially so that her next attack on them can begin earlier.
Swapping the target to an enemy trapped by
Yordle Snap Trap
or
90 Caliber Net
also reduces her ongoing attack cooldown.
PENDING FOR TEST:
: The exact attack cooldown refund appears to be 50% of the attack cooldown at current attack speed, but at a minimum amount it lets
Caitlyn
start the attack against the trapped target within 0.
5
seconds of her previous attack windup completing.
The bonus range from
Rapid Firecannon
will not have any effect during
trap
and
net
extended
Headshot
attacks.
Only the ordinary
100% attack damage
portion of the attack can critically strike. The bonus from
Headshot
is added after the critical strike is rolled.
The full damage of
Headshot
applies
life steal
.
Headshot
is a single instance of damage, thus does not trigger
Amumu's
Tantrum's
or
Warden's Mail
passives twice.
The basic attack triggering
Headshot
can
critically strike
, but
Headshot's
damage remains unchanged if it does.
Since
Caitlyn's
Art and Sustainability Update, Ability-granted
Headshots
are the same as the original
Headshot
override attack, though what lets them cast at high range is still relatively special. They trigger
on-attack
effects (including stacking
Headshot
).
PENDING FOR TEST:
Runaan's Hurricane's
Wind's Fury
, is special cased to search targets with the increased range as well.
Because
Headshot
stacks are generated
on-attack
,
Runaan's Hurricane
bolts will not generate stacks towards
Headshot
.
The empowered attack will not trigger against
wards
.
Stacks will still be generated towards
Headshot
when attacking them.

Renowned as its finest peacekeeper, Caitlyn is also Piltover’s best shot at ridding the city of its elusive criminal elements. She is often paired with Vi, acting as a cool counterpoint to her partner’s more impetuous nature. Even though she carries a one-of-a-kind hextech rifle, Caitlyn’s most powerful weapon is her superior intellect, allowing her to lay elaborate traps for any lawbreakers foolish enough to operate in the City of Progress.

Trivia
[

]
In Western culture, the name Caitlyn is believed to be derived from the Greek Αἰκατερίνα (Aikaterine).
Katarina's
name has the same roots.
Caitlyn's accent is a
Received Pronunciation
spoken in south of
England
.
Caitlyn's rifle can be seen in the
trailer
for the game's Mac version.
A
Yordle Snap Trap
can be seen shortly after.
Caitlyn has the longest base
basic attack range
in the game at
650 units
.
Her dance and taunts resemble several rifle moves in modern
Color guard
corps.
Headshots
actually fires at the target's head; this is most noticeable with tall targets like
Baron Nashor
or
Enemy Turrets
.
When Caitlyn and Vi are on the same team, they are granted the cosmetic buff
On the Case
. This buff gives them extra
gold
when they score a
takedown
together.
If there is a
Jinx
on the enemy team, Caitlyn gets the cosmetic debuff
Catch me if you can!
This debuff displays a counter of 'criminals apprehended' (kills/assists scored against Jinx).
Caitlyn,
Blitzcrank
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Sion
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Viego
,
Xerath
, and

are the only champions who can apply
crowd control
on themselves.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.

League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.
League of Legends content
Brush
Brush
is a common terrain feature that obstructs
sight
for any unit outside of it.
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

True sight
True Sight

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver

Root
A unit that is
rooted
is unable to control its movement or activate movement spells for the duration. This effect does not innately
knockdown

Headshot
Innate:
Caitlyn's
basic attacks generate stacks of
Count

basic attack
will fire a
Headshot

critical strike chance
.
On
trapped

netted
targets, she gains another
Headshot

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash

Interrupts:
Interrupts

dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration

forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity

Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse

Kinematics
A unit that is under the effect of
kinematics
will be continually dragged to a specific unit or location until they reach it.
Kinematics
has no effect on units that are performing any form of movement other than basic movement and other
kinematic
effects.
Kinematics
should not be confused as an
airborne
effect nor displacement effect. It does not disable any of the unit's actions.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent the unit from effectively
pathing

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity

The
strength

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
