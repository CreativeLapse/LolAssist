Autonomous attack range scales with

Purge
uses
edge range
for enemy targets only; Its range is
center-to-edge
.
Urgot's
size
increasing does not increase its range.
The initial cast and the manual recast count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Before maximum rank, if
Purge
is not manually recasted, the effect will end without being considered as an ability activation.
Urgot's
facing direction during
Purge
is in the direction he's moving and not in the direction of his attack target.
Before maximum rank, if continuously attacking without being interrupted or interrupting or canceling the cast,
Urgot
will attack 13 times.
The bolts are considered basic attacks and thus apply
life steal
at full efficiency.
During
Purge
,
Urgot's
attack range
is reduced by 200 and his attack commands instead issue movement commands to walk into the respective range of his target.
Slow resist
does not modify flat reductions in movement speed.
Percentage

apply after the flat movement reduction.
Purge's
attacks do not interact with
Urgot's
basic attack
timer.
After ending
Purge
, he can usually attack again immediately.
If
Urgot
is
berserked
or
taunted
, he will fire at the unit he is forced to attack.
Purge
will fire while
Urgot
is
dashing
(e.g. while taking
Thresh's
Dark Passage
), with the exception of
Disdain's
dash.
Each shot counts as a separate hit for effects such as
Electrocute
,
Muramana's
Shock
, and
Eclipse's
Ever Rising Moon
.
Purge
will apply
Runaan's Hurricane
on every shot at 100% of the listed damage.
On-hit damage applied by the bolts are still reduced by
Purge
.
The movement speed stat tooltip erroneously reads that the
bonus
movement speed is being reduced before
base
movement speed.

.
Fear Beyond Death
can be recast if the leashed target falls to
low health
, and does so automatically afterwards if they remain at
low health
. It will also recast if the chem-drill would kill the target.
Recast:
Urgot

the target and reels them in,

them and rendering them
untargetable
. He then
executes
them, which briefly
fears
and

Fear Beyond Death

Recast - Mercy:
Urgot
launches chains at the leashed target, then
channels
for 1.
5
seconds once they latch on. During this time, he reels them toward him,
suppressing
them,
revealing
them, rendering them
untargetable
, and preventing them from taking damage from
other sources
. If the target is near
Urgot
when the chains connect, they are pushed up to
1000
units away based on their proximity to him. This channel cannot be
interrupted
by
crowd control
.
Upon completing the channel, the target is
executed

Unlike most
missiles
,
Fear Beyond Death
can
hit the edge of targets whose center is further than the missile range.
However, it still cannot hit targets whose center is behind
Urgot
.
Applies
spell damage
on first cast and
raw damage
on recast.
Urgot
is
revealed
while the target is leashed and being reeled in.
Fear Beyond Death's
execute against the enemy champion will aggro nearby enemy minions.
While
Fear Beyond Death
is not on cooldown, all enemy champions will have an execution indicator on their health bar, and a visual indicator if below the execution threshold.
Mercy's
granted
untargetability
does not
destroy
in-flight
projectiles
for the target.
Urgot
will place himself onto the ground and interrupts
displacements
affecting him upon starting the channel.
If the displacement effect is a
knock up
with no debuff source, the
airborne
status is not removed and he spends significantly less time in the air.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.
Fear Beyond Death
prevents
Purge
from firing for 0.
8
seconds.
The recast prevents
Purge
from firing for 1.
5
seconds.
If
Urgot
is in
cast time
or is
dashing
while the chains are in transit,
Mercy's
forced movement will be deferred (the debuff will continuously refresh) until the cast or dash is complete. The target will still be
untargetable
, prevented from taking damage from other sources, and
suppressed
during this time.
If
Urgot
is
channeling
a spell, the channel is interrupted when the chains hit.
Removing or resisting the
slow
has no effect on the mark
debuff
.
The initial cast always counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
If the ability hits a target who is below the threshold, it will automatically recast itself and it won't be considered as an ability activation.
If the ability hits a target who is above the threshold and it's recast early, the recast will happen automatically when they reach the threshold and it won't be considered as an ability activation.
If the target got hit while above the threshold and it is recast after they fall below it, the recast will be considered as an ability activation.
Reactivating the ability early will reel the target as soon as they reach the
25%
maximum
health
threshold.
Mercy
can be cast and will automatically do so at the end of the duration if the target is below the execute threshold regardless of
Urgot
being affected by
crowd control
, including self or enemy-imposed
stasis
.
Fear Beyond Death
can affect
clones
and activates its fear when executing one.
Fear Beyond Death's
recast cannot be used if the target is
untargetable
.
Fear Beyond Death's
recast cannot be used during
resurrection
. Attempting to do so places the recast on a 5-second
cooldown
.
If the target is below the threshold at the end of the duration and
Urgot
is revived, the recast will initiate regardless of this cooldown.
The recast's chains are classified as a
projectile
and they will fail to affect their target if:
Urgot
or his target
dies
or enters
resurrection
.
The target becomes
untargetable
, even if the granted source does not
destroy
in-flight projectiles.
Urgot
will also fail to execute the target if they become
untargetable
while the chains are being pulled.
(note)
They collide with
Wind Wall
or
Unbreakable
.
If
Unbreakable
intercepts the chains and
Braum
is not the target, they're destroyed.
If
Braum
is the target, he will still be reeled in and executed as normal.
The target is
crowd control immune
when the chains hit.
The target is
a zombie
.
Spell shield
will
not
block the recast's chains.
If the target removes the
suppression
by any means they will prevent themselves from being
executed
and stop the forced movement from being renewed, though allowing the most recent one to be present and move them to
Urgot's
previous location.
Their untargetability and damage prevention of other sources granted by
Fear Beyond Death
is removed in the process.
Urgot
will still complete the full channel despite this.
The execution would not count as being successful in this case and thus he will not
fear
nearby enemies after the failed execution.
If the target is
displacement immune
when the chains collide,
Urgot
will not begin the channel until after their displacement immunity ends.
The target will be unaffected by
Fear Beyond Death's
forced movement during this time, but will still be suppressed, prevented from taking damage from other sources and rendered untargetable.
If the target's displacement immunity does not end within 10 seconds,
Fear Beyond Death
will cancel.
When the chains start reeling in and suppressing a
player's
champion, chains will also cover the sides of their screen.
The target champion shrinks in
size
in several steps after reaching
Urgot's
grinder and before being executed.
If the
suppression
ends in any way, the target returns to its normal size.
If the execution is successful, the victim's corpse will be effectively invisible unless they enter a
zombie state
.
The target will die regardless of their
current
health
once the recast's chains hit, even if they are
healed
.
If the target has
invulnerability
that persists for the duration of the channel, it will protect them from the execution.
Undying Rage
will prevent
Tryndamere
from dying by the execute. In this case, the execute will bypass his minimum health threshold though and reduce him to
1 health
.
The effect will also not prevent the activation of
resurrection
effects, such as
Guardian Angel
or
Anivia's
Rebirth
.
Post-death events
such as
Zombie State
effects (e.g,
Karthus'
Death Defied
,
Kog'Maw's
Icathian Surprise
, and
Sion's
Glory in Death
) will be triggered.
Only the target's
current
health
will count as
Urgot's
damage in post-game statistics and
spell vamp
healing.
Fear Beyond Death's
initial cast will not perform the automatic recast from dealing enough damage to kill
Sion
.
Fear Beyond Death's
recast will be placed on a 5-second
cooldown
if the target is below the threshold and becomes targetable again after completing the dash from
Hero's Entrance

Once a powerful Noxian headsman, Urgot was betrayed by the empire for which he had killed so many. Bound in iron chains, he was forced to learn the true meaning of strength in the Dredge—a prison mine deep beneath Zaun. Emerging in a disaster that spread chaos throughout the city, he now casts an imposing shadow over its criminal underworld. Raising his victims on the very chains that once enslaved him, he will purge his new home of the unworthy, making it a crucible of pain.

Emerging from the deep sea as the first of the kaiju menace, Crabgot has never been completely defeated by the forces of humanity. The best result when it emerges is to temporarily halt its advance, sending the massive crustacean back into the sea... until it can rise once more.

A titanium juggernaut used to crush pockets of particularly stubborn resistance, the Battlecast Urgot model is rarely seen but widely feared. Its extensive weapons systems are complemented by a massive, flesh-grinding spike mill, which it pulls fleeing opponents into for sheer spectacle.

Jeremiah James was once a famed railroad baron and millionaire industrialist, who bet his own heart on a game of chance… and lost. Left alone in the desert to die, he bargained with a passing devil, trading his immortal soul for a twisted, monstrous body of gears and iron.

Unctuous Uncle Urgot has no nose to smell
No feet or toes to stink, but he's still feeling swell
'Cause visitors arrive and ring the household bell
With new parts not so rotten for him, and tummy snacks as well!

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
Urgot, the Headsman's Pride
Urgot and
Thresh
used to be the only champions classified as
ranged
tanks
before having their roles changes in 2013.
Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser
and
Death Sentence
are the only two in-game tethered abilities without a minimum leash range.
Urgot used to be the only champion in the game classified as a
Marksman
/
Tank
. However, his champion classification has since been changed to
Juggernaut
.
During the time that
Gnar
was revealed on PBE, he was classified as a
Marksman
/
Tank
. However, Gnar was released as a
Fighter
/
Marksman
, a champion classification he shared with
Jayce
.
Urgot resembles a number of quadrupeds from various other games.
Makron
(leader of the
Strogg
) from the
Quake
video game series.
Azmodan
the Lord of Sin from
Diablo III
.
"The Spineless Ones"
from the
X-Men
, the best-known of them being
Mojo
. They are a fat alien race of rotten appearance who can not move on their own without advanced technology.
Yagrum Bagarn
from
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
.
According to Babaganoosh, Urgot was unavailable for the Ionia vs Noxus match due to being damaged and needing considerable time to be repaired. He received a major strength buff in the following patch release.
Urgot's dance references
Kirby's
Victory Dance
.
A side by side comparison can be seen
here
.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called
"Urfgot"
, referencing
Urf
.
Urgot, the Dreadnought
Urgot
is one of 21 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Aatrox
,
Camille
,
Darius
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
K'Sante

,
Pyke
,
Riven
,
Samira
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Xayah
,
Yone
, and
Zed
.
His dance references the
Can-Can
.
He shares this dance with
Elise
and
Final Boss Veigar
.
His login screen theme is sung in Noxian. The repeated chant is "Stom Ur Got!"
[2]
During his second champion spotlight for his rework,
David 'Phreak' Turley
jokingly said that Urgot will be the next
Star Guardian
, a reference to a long-standing
joke
in the community, which partially became true with
Pajama Guardian Cosplay Urgot
being released for the 2020
April Fools' Day
event.
Urgot is able to kill the Enemy Target Dummies in the
Practice Tool
, by using
Fear Beyond Death
on them when they have 25% health or lower.
Urgot's joke will cause him to retrieve an item:
Poison Puffcap
.
Crab
.
Rubber Ducky
.
Gold Duck.
[3]
This item is a rare variant of the animation.

Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Juggernauts
are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility.

Mana
(also known as

champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge

Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind

0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed

slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.

duration.
Berserk
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Forced action effects
cannot
force the unit to perform an action that is disabled.
Units that are
berserk
search for targets within a
1000 radius of them. Sources of
berserk
have their own targeting priority system, including the
berserked
unit's allies. The target does not need to be visible for the
berserked
unit to attack them.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
and windups against the acquired target) and all

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
