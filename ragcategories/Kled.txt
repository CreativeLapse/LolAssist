Skaarl, the Cowardly Lizard
Innate:
Kled
rides his semi-trusty steed,
Skaarl
, whom takes damage for him while he is
Mounted
. When
Skaarl's
health depletes,
Kled
dismounts,
cleansing
from all
crowd control
.
Kled
remains
Dismounted
until he returns to the
summoning platform
, but can restore
Skaarl's
Courage
by fighting enemies. At maximum
Courage
,
Kled
becomes
Mounted
with a portion of '
Skaarl's
health.
Dismounted:
Kled
gains
bonus
movement speed
while moving toward enemy champions, but his basic attacks deal less damage to champions.
Bear Trap on a Rope
is replaced with
Pocket Pistol
, and
Kled
cannot cast his other abilities.
Innate:
Kled
rides his semi-trusty mount,
Skaarl
. While
Mounted
, all damage dealt to the duo is suffered by
Skaarl
, who has
400 − 1550 (based on level)
base
health
; additional sources of health are applied to
Skaarl's
maximum
health
. Effects based on percentage health consider
Kled
and
Skaarl's
combined
maximum
health
.
Being reduced to
0 health
causes
Skaarl
to flee, forcing
Kled
to be
Dismounted
, with all damage in excess of
Skaarl's
health being ignored. Upon dismounting,
Kled
dashes
in the direction of the allied
Nexus
, though not through terrain,
cleanses
himself of all
crowd control
and becomes
unable to act
,
untargetable
, and
immune to crowd control
for 0.
5
seconds.
While
Kled
is
Dismounted
, his
base
health
and
base
movement speed
are reduced, however, he gains
bonus
movement speed
while moving toward enemy champions. His
base
attack range
is increased, his attacks deal 80% damage to champions
Bear Trap on a Rope
is replaced with
Pocket Pistol
, and
Jousting
and
Chaaaaaaaarge!!!
become unusable.

Kled's
health is rounded up while

health is rounded down.
The rounding is only visual and bears no effect on gameplay.
While untargetable,
Kled
will
destroy
allied projectiles in addition to enemy projectiles.
(bug)
Health regeneration
and
healing
affects either only
Kled's
or
Skaarl's
health, prioritizing
Skaarl's
health until full.
Excess damage dealt to
Skaarl
counts for the purposes of damage trackers,
Death's Dance's

and other effects based on damage dealt.
(bug)
If
Skaarl's
health is reduced to 0 by
Eclipse's

Kled
will take the triggering attack's damage.

Dismounted
Innate:
While
Dismounted
,
Kled
suffers all damage taken and is vulnerable to
death
.
Kled's
base health
cannot be improved through any means, his
movement speed
is reduced, and his
basic attacks
against
champions
deal less
physical damage
. However,
Kled
gains a large amount of
bonus
movement speed
when moving toward
visible
enemy champions, and he has the ability to restore
Skaarl's
Courage
to
mount
again.
Courage:
Kled gains a large amount of
Courage
by
basic attacking
champions or scoring
takedowns
against them within 3 seconds of damaging them, and a small amount when killing
minions
, or attacking
structures
or epic
monsters
. At 100
Courage
,
Skaarl
returns and
Kled
becomes
Mounted
.
Kled's
own
health
is preserved through re-mounting. Entering the
fountain
will always restore
Courage
and return
Skaarl
. Outside of the fountain,
Kled
cannot gain
Courage
for 30 seconds after re-mounting.
Innate:
Kled
is only vulnerable to
death
while
Dismounted
.
Kled
has
410 − 1838 (based on level)
base
health
, which is not improved by sources of
bonus
health
, as well as reduced
base
movement speed
and increased
attack range
. Effects based on percentage health consider
Kled
and
Skaarl's
combined
maximum
health
, meaning that a
Dismounted
Kled
is always considered to be
low
health.
Kled
gains
100 − 185 (based on level)
bonus
movement speed
while moving towards and
after attacking
visible
enemy
champions
within
1000
units, but his
basic attacks
against them are reduced to
80% AD
physical damage
. Additionally, he gains the ability to restore
Skaarl's
Courage
to
mount
again.
Innate - Courage:
Kled
gains 15
Courage
after completing a basic attack against a champion, 20
Courage
whenever he scores a
takedown
against an enemy
champion
within 3 seconds of damaging them, 4
Courage
for
minion
kills, and 5
Courage
when basic attacking a
structure
or epic
monster
. At 100
Courage
,
Skaarl
returns with
45 / 55 / 65 / 75% (based on level)
of
Skaarl's
maximum
health
and
Kled
becomes
Mounted
after 0.
7
seconds.
Mounting up
resets the
cooldowns
of
Bear Trap on a Rope
,
Pocket Pistol
and
Jousting
.
While at the allied
fountain
, 25
Courage
is generated every 0.
25
seconds. If reuniting outside of base,
Skaarl
gets
Frayed Nerves
, which prevents him from gaining
Courage
for 30 seconds.
The current status of
Kled's
own health is preserved between subsequent dismounts. While
Mounted
,
healing
and
health regeneration
will first replenish
Skaarl's
health and will only apply to
Kled's
health while
Skaarl

health.

After completing a
basic attack
on a champion, the bonus movement speed buff is granted for 1.
5
seconds regardless of whether he is moving towards a
visible
enemy or not.
Kled
will neither gain courage nor bonus movement speed if his basic attack is
dodged
,
blocked
or
missed
.
It is possible to get the
Courage
from base but have
Kled
and
Skaarl
reunite out of base.
If
Kled
achieves 100
Courage
while
resurrecting
or enters it while in the process of remounting, the remount will be deferred to after he revives.

A warrior as fearless as he is ornery, the yordle Kled embodies the furious bravado of Noxus. He is an icon beloved by the empire’s soldiers, distrusted by its officers, and loathed by the nobility. Many claim Kled has fought in every campaign the legions have waged, has 'acquired' every military title, and has never once backed down from a fight. Though the truth of the matter is often questionable, one part of his legend is undeniable: Charging into battle on his un-trusty steed, Skaarl, Kled fights to protect what’s his… and to take whatever he can get.

Sir Prince Chevalier Archduke Lord Double-Earl Kled (or Sir Kled, for short) is a half-mad knight from the aptly named Kingdom of Kled, which contains exactly two subjects: Kled, and his cowardly avian mount, Skarl. Together, the pair ravage the countryside to 'reclaim' Kled's 'land', which apparently is… all land, everywhere.

Throughout history, the Marauders have balanced on the knife's edge between brutality and cunning. General Kled, one half of the pair that currently leads the regime, is truly the incarnation of their historic brutality… and little more. If it weren't for Xin Zhao, Kled would bet everything on a final, bloody, battle.

He's just a lil' guy wearing a bowl of Poro-Pup Chow as a hat, riding the bestest beagle into battle. The get-up won Kled and Skaarl a blue ribbon at Beagle's Bridge, so if ain't broke, don't fix it. Here's hoping that the more "refined" judges at this year's Summoner Sweetie's Pet Show agree.

Kled and

Kled is also the first champion and one of the two champions in the game whose health cannot be improved except through growth per level, the second being
Pyke
.
Kled, while
dismounted
, has the lowest base
movement speed
of all champions at 285.
Mr. Kled's Wild Ride
is most likely a reference to the Disneyland attraction
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride

Mr. Kled's Wild Ride
is a probable reference to "
MR BONES WILD RIDE
", a custom roller coaster built in
RollerCoaster Tycoon 2
called  that took in game years to complete its course. Then, once a passenger finally got off the ride, it led back to the start of the ride, creating an never-ending cycle of riding the attraction. One of the most famous quotes that a ton of riders thought was "I want to get off 'MR BONES WILD RIDE'".
Kled is the first champion to swear (albeit censored) in-game.
Kled's

dance references the

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.

Fury
Fury
is an umbrella term for many named resources that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
or
Energy
that exist in some quantity beforehand. For most users, this resource is only required by a single ability or passive effect.
It represents
momentum
and encourages sustained aggression from users, often gating a power-spike or empowerment.
Fury
generation varies between users, but is always generated
in-combat
(e.g. on-hit, ability casts or taking damage) and often decays when out of combat.

League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.

Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.
"
Cleanse
" does not always refer to the act of removing
all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.
A
cleanse
does not remove
Stasis
, but will remove the disable portion of
Airborne

League of Legends content
Crowd control
A unit that is
disabled
is affected by a status effect that prevents certain actions – such as movement, attacking, casting and/or seeing–blocked, reduced or controlled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Bear Trap on a Rope
COOLDOWN:
11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7
Active:
Kled
throws a bear trap in the target direction that deals
physical damage

monster
hit,
revealing
them.
The tether shrinks over a brief time, after which
Kled

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Lockout
A champion that is
locked out
is unable to perform certain actions such as casting abilities, moving, or attacking. The prevented actions can vary per instance.
Lockout does not interact with
crowd control
mechanics unless otherwise stated.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Cc-Immune
Crowd control immunity
prevents
any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic
monsters
(excluding a summoned
Rift Herald
) and
turrets
are always immune to all crowd control, with the exception of
stasis
.

Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall
or
Blade Whirl
(usually vanishing without any effect).
The following abilities perform one or more
projectile popping events
:
Most
abilities and effects that grant
untargetability
pop projectiles when the unit gains the status effect.
Master Yi's
Alpha Strike
in particular pops targeted projectiles on each game tick for its duration.
Gwen's
Hallowed Mist
pops all projectiles (from enemy champions outside of its area of effect) targeted at her that attempt to pass through or be inside its area of effect.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
