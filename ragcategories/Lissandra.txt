Innate:
Whenever an enemy champion dies while
Lissandra
is nearby, she spawns a
Frozen Thrall
from their corpse.
Frozen Thralls
are
invulnerable

slow
nearby enemies and gain increasing

movement speed
and
slow
nearby enemies by 25%. They will chase nearby

Thralls
are units that are considered champions (they are
clones
) and they take the form of the champion they arise from.
Additionally, near the end of their life span, they will cue that champion's
basic attack
animation.
They cannot be teleported by an allied
Realm Warp
.
Thralls
are
untargetable
and
invulnerable
.
Thralls
are revealed to enemies through the fog of war.
Thralls
will continue to chase their target even if they enter a
brush
.
Iceborn Subjugation
will not summon a
Thrall
against enemy champions that enter a
zombie state
, and will instead summon one after they've left the state.

Blocked
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Ice Shard
picks a location 950 units away in the direction of the cast for the shattered missile to end up at.
The initial
Ice Shard
missile has a range of 700 units which it arrives at after
0.
33
seconds
. If it hasn't collided with an enemy in this path when it does, it checks for enemies in a
100 radius around the point 25 units in front of it.
Colliding or hitting an enemy in either fashion creates a new "shattered" missile with the same speed but greater width that continues to travel along the same line to the designated point 950 units from the cast's original position, originating at the location at which the initial missile collided at.
Spell shield
will block the damage and the slow but will not stop the projectile from shattering.

As the reclusive leader of the Frostguard, many believe Lissandra is a living saint whose followers bring healing and wisdom to the tribes of the Freljord. The truth is perhaps more sinister, as she uses her elemental magic to twist the power of True Ice into something dark and terrible, entombing or impaling any who would reveal her deepest secrets. Indeed, the legacy of her past may yet be the beginning of the end for Runeterra.

Once a powerful sorceress who sought absolute control over her followers, Lissandra transformed into something altogether different when she finally found the hallowed Bloodstone. The magic she drew from it drove her to slay those who once tended to her every whim. To this day she wanders in search of more mortals to sacrifice to her newfound source of power.

Long ago, the sorceress Lissandra stole the Snake Relic from the ancient Protectors in a bid to gain immortality. Cast down and sealed away for her crimes, Lissandra spent centuries of solitude scheming a way to take all twelve Zodiac Relics for herself, waiting for the perfect time to strike... And now Ezreal has given her the chance.

She and her army of roller-skating derby goons will stop at nothing to eliminate disco forever. But for her latest scheme to work, she's going to need an invite to the disco to end all discos: The Jam.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Lissandra first appeared in the
Journal of Justice
,
Issue 2
, several years before her announcement as a champion. Like now, she was portrayed as the leader of one of the three tribes of the Freljord, but her portrayal was originally vastly different, as a mortal princess allied with
Ashe
's tribe.
This was later revealed to be her alter ego, and most people are not aware of her being the Ice Witch herself.
If Ashe, Lissandra, and/or
Sejuani
are played on opposing teams,
Battle for Freljord
will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the title of 'Queen of Freljord' (complete with a floating ice crown floating above their heads) referencing the civil war taking place there, between the three tribes each lead.
Lissandra is the only champion to possess a single-targeted ability (
Frozen Tomb
) that can be used on herself but not on allies.
Lissandra,
Elise
, and
Lucian
are the only champions to feature a monologue on their login screens.
Lissandra
may be the feminine form of Greek name Λύσανδρος (Lysander or "liberator").
Her champion theme is the same as the pick music of
ARAM
and is titled "Freljord".
Lissandra,
Blitzcrank
,
Caitlyn
,
Rumble
,
Sion
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Viego
,
Xerath
, and
Ziggs
are the only champions who can apply
crowd control
on themselves.

Burst
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Burst Mages
aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Invulnerability
A unit that is
Invulnerable
reduces all damage taken to
0
and prevents effects that trigger from damage.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter

Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion

Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
