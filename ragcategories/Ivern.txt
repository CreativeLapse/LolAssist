Friend of the Forest
Innate:
Ivern
cannot attack nor damage non-epic
monsters
. When he targets a jungle camp, he
plants
a magical
grove
under it at the cost of
health
and
mana
. The
grove
charges up over time to fully mature, upon which
Ivern
can then target the monsters to instantly clear the camp. Using
Smite
on a monster in the
grove
will clear the camp regardless of maturity.
Innate:
Ivern
cannot attack nor damage non-epic
monsters
. Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2.
5
second
channel
that will plant a
grove
upon the camp. Placing a
grove
costs
94.
5
− 0.
14
(based on level)
health
and
90 − 0.
37
(based on level)
mana
. The channel cannot be cancelled in the first 0.
15
seconds and in the last 0.
5
seconds.
Ivern
cannot place a grove while he is unable to cast abilities.
The
grove
matures over
40 − 1 (based on level)
seconds. When fully matured,
Ivern
can target the camp again to
free
it after a 0.
5
-second
cast time
, clearing the camp and receiving the
full gold
and
full experience
bounties
. Using
Smite
on a monster within the
grove
will instantly
free
the camp regardless of maturity.
If the camp's large monster has already been slain prior to planting a
grove
,
Ivern
will
free
the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the
grove
will instantly mature if the large monster is slain.

Freeing a
Krugs
camp will only give the
gold

Mini Krugs
, for a total of
95 − 128.

The entire

Mini Krugs
, for a total of
153 − 206.

and

.
Ivern
must be within
275 units of the
large monster
of the targeted camp to start channeling or collect a
grove
. The large monsters also must be
visible
.
If
Ivern
cannot afford the cost to place a grove,
Friend of the Forest
is placed on a cooldown equal to the number of seconds it takes for his
health regeneration
and/or
mana regeneration
to restore him to the amount of health and/or mana needed to afford the cost.
The cooldown will update based on
Ivern's
current
health and mana regeneration, as well as his
current
health and mana.
Friend of the Forest
can be used while
Ivern
or the camp is in combat and, once the
grove
is placed,
Smite
can be used to instantly claim the camp.
Interrupting
Ivern's
channel is the only way to contest jungle camps, short of killing the camp during the channel time.
Saplings
cannot be gathered by allied champions in a
zombie state
nor allied
clones
.
Saplings
can be gathered while
untargetable
.
Allied
clones
killing buff monsters will also cause a
sapling
to be spawned.
Freeing a
grove
causes the monsters within the camp to be dealt
5000 true damage
in the
internalraw damage
source type by
Ivern
, despite his inability to damage them.
Friend of the Forest
will leave
Ivern
at
1 health
if cast with exactly the required amount.
Friend of the Forest
cannot be cast with less, unlike other abilities with health costs.

Ivern
is not able to dash to the target unless they are within approximately 1200 range.

Ivern

Ivern Bramblefoot, known to many as the Green Father, is a peculiar half man, half tree who roams Runeterra’s forests, cultivating life everywhere he goes. He knows the secrets of the natural world, and holds deep friendships with all things that grow, fly, and scuttle. Ivern wanders the wilderness, imparting strange wisdom to any he meets, enriching the forests, and occasionally entrusting loose-lipped butterflies with his secrets.

Added
Friend of the Forest
– Innate
Ivern
cannot attack or damage non-epic
monsters
. Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2.
5
-second
channel
that, upon completion, places the monsters within a
grove
. Placing a grove costs
health
and
mana
, and cannot be cast if
Ivern
lacks the resources.
The
grove
matures over
40 − 6 (based on level)
seconds. When fully matured,
Ivern
can interact with the camp again to instantly
free
the monsters, sending them away while receiving their full
gold
and
experience
bounty
.
Smiting
a camp within a
grove
will instantly
free
the monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monster's current health.
If the camp's large
monster
has already been slain,
Ivern
will
free
the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the
grove
will instantly mature if the large monster is slain.
Starting at level 5, freeing the
Red Brambleback
or
Blue Sentinel
leaves behind a
sapling
that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp's buff, consuming it in the process. If at least one allied
champion
is nearby,
Ivern
can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only
Ivern
can consume.

]
Ivern is an
anagram
of
Riven
.
On
V9.20
, Ivern became the first champion to have its range type changed, from
Melee
to
Ranged
.
If Ivern
summons
Daisy and then dances, she will also dance.
Daisy's
animations were reused from the
Blue Sentinel's
.
Because of this, she shared its dance, which references
Open the Door
by
Im Chang-jung
.
Before the rework of the
Rift Herald
in patch
V7.9
, she also shared this dance with her.

Catcher
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Catchers
specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.
Examples
Blitzcrank
Morgana
Zyra
League of Legends content
Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Jungler
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted

Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt
)
Silence
(
Disrupt

Krug camp
The
Ancient Krug
,
Krug
, and
Mini Krug
are neutral
monsters
on
Summoner's Rift
.
The
Krug camp
consists of one
large
Ancient Krug
and one
medium
Krug
. Killing the
Ancient Krug
will spawn four
lesser
Krugs
, and killing
medium
Krugs
will spawn two
lesser
Mini Krugs
, for a total of 8 units. Killing this camp awards
gold
and
experience
.
All additional units spawned will spawn with one lower level (capped at level 1) and will
despawn
after being out of combat for some time.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Interrupt
Interrupt
is a quality of crowd control that
interrupts
an in-progress effect, preventing its completion or causing the effect to go off at an
interrupted

abilities (unless otherwise noted by the ability):
Airborne
Forced action

Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion
after
Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
. It prevents enemies from gaining full kill credit or triggering most on-kill effects from the champion a second time, and some abilities (e.g.
You and Me!
) interact differently with champions in this state.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
and
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects.
The following effects trigger a champion to enter a
zombie state
:
Karthus'
Death Defied
Kog'Maw's
Icathian Surprise
Sion's
Glory in Death

Clone
A
clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet
that attempts to imitate a
champion
, copying their current vitality, stats, items, level, and most status effects upon creation. They are considered champions against many effects that do not strictly require
player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.
The
damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a
clone
awards
25
and
44
.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Raw damage
Raw damage
is a type of damage that normally ignores resistances,
shields
, and
minimum health threshold
and
resurrection
effects on the target.
Invulnerability
and
spell shields
,  where applicable, are the only ways to reduce or negate
raw damage
. Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against an enemy always deal more than
100% of the target's
current
health
(
"execution damage"
). Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against the player's own champion or an ally are special-cased to take place during effects that protect champions from death. Current implementations of
minimum health thresholds
are special-cased to leave units at
1 health
rather than the threshold, when they are dealt lethal
raw damage
.
Raw damage
does not interact with
any
effect.
Internal raw
damage is a form of
raw damage
that also bypasses
invulnerability
and has no overrides in place to prevent it from killing death-protected champions. The
Nexus Obelisk
,
Zac's
Cell Division
redirected damage, and
Rift Herald's
self-damage also have this modified form.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Root
A unit that is
rooted
is unable to control its movement or activate movement spells for the duration. This effect does not innately

Rooted
units can still be displaced.
Root

League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
