Anivia is a benevolent winged spirit who endures endless cycles of life, death, and rebirth to protect the Freljord. A demigod born of unforgiving ice and bitter winds, she wields those elemental powers to thwart any who dare disturb her homeland. Anivia guides and protects the tribes of the harsh north, who revere her as a symbol of hope, and a portent of great change. She fights with every ounce of her being, knowing that through her sacrifice, her memory will endure, and she will be reborn into a new tomorrow.

Despite her festive colors, Anivia is an incredibly poor sport. She has been known to wall off the exits to locker rooms and fire icicles at her teammates when faced with a loss, behavior that would would be disciplined... if she hadn't frozen the judges and referees.

Battlemage
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Battlemages
(also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.

League of Legends content
Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Middle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Mid Laner
is the champion assigned to the mid lane.
Burst Mages
,
Artillery Mages
, and
Assassins
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Mid Laner
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.
League of Legends content
Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects. Entering
resurrection
does not cancel cast times.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.
League of Legends content
Lockout
A champion that is
locked out
is unable to perform certain actions such as casting abilities, moving, or attacking. The prevented actions can vary per instance.
Lockout does not interact with
crowd control
mechanics unless otherwise stated.
League of Legends content
Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the

Generally, a

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm

Flee

Taunt

Ultra Rapid Fire (U.R.F.)
Ultra Rapid Fire
is a
Featured Game Mode
that takes place on
Summoner's Rift
with the same objective as
Classic 5v5
, except all
champions
benefit from the
Awesome Buff of Awesomely Awesome Buffing
that grants excessive  ability haste and removes ability costs. The gameplay is
explosive
. The game mode can be played as
All Random

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/

.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing

airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
