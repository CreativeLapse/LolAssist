The Hitman and the Seer
Innate:
Aphelios
wields 5 Lunari Weapons made by his sister
Alune
. He has access to two at a time:
main weapon
and
off-hand
weapon. Each weapon has a unique basic attack and a
active ability.
Moonlight:
Attacks and abilities consume a weapon's ammo. When out of ammo,
Aphelios
discards the weapon to the reserve and
Alune
summons the next of the 5.
Weapon Master:
Aphelios
cannot improve his abilities with skill points, instead he spend those for
bonus
stats:
attack damage
,
attack speed
, and
lethality
.
Innate:
Aphelios
has access to an arsenal of 5
Moonstone Weapons
, created by his sister
Alune
. He equips two weapons at any one time, one as his
main weapon
and one as his
off-hand
. Each weapon has a unique
basic attack
and passive effect.
Aphelios
begins the game with
Calibrum
as his
main weapon
and
Severum
in his
off-hand
, with
Gravitum
,
Infernum
, and
Crescendum
queued in reserve. The queue order can be rearranged based on weapon usage.
Innate - Moonlight:
Weapons spawn with 50
Moonlight
for
ammunition
, which is consumed on basic attacks
on-attack
or to cast his
abilities
. Abilities that cause
Aphelios
to attack do not cost additional
Moonlight
on top of their ability cost. Once his
main weapon
is exhausted of
Moonlight
, it is moved to the end of the queue and
Aphelios
assembles his next available weapon over 1 second to equip it from his reserve, with its
ability being placed on a 1.
5
-second
cooldown
before that time.
Aphelios
cannot cast
Phase
during the assembly.
Innate - Weapon Master:
Aphelios
cannot improve his abilities with
skill points
. He starts the game with
Phase
and gains access to
abilities
at level 2 and
Moonlight Vigil
at level 6, with the latter improving automatically at levels 11 and 16. Instead,
Aphelios
may spend his skill points to gain
bonus
attack damage
,
bonus
attack speed
or
lethality
.
Bonus Attack Damage:
5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 / 30

Info

Passive
The
level up
for the bonus
attack damage
,
attack speed
, and
armor penetration
have hotkeys Q, W, E, respectively.
Assigning points
does not
follow the same rules as conventional point expenditure. The quickest you can get an individual statistic to rank-6 is by assigning points at 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 7 / 9.
An ammunition counter will appear to the right side of the screen at 10 or less
Moonlight
.
Abilities can still be used with less than the required amount of
Moonlight
, consuming all remaining
Moonlight
in the process.
Runaan's Hurricane
does not consume additional
Moonlight
for his basic attacks.
The icon for this ability changes based on the active skin and functions as
Alune's
portrait, similarly to
Aphelios'
portrait.

fires a concentrated blast of moonlight that explodes upon hitting an enemy champion, dealing
physical damage
to enemy champions in the area. Then
basic attacks
rain from the sky to the targets, dealing
physical damage
and applying unique effects of his
main weapon

heals
Aphelios

Infernum
: The initial blast deals increased damage, and the attacks splash on each target.
Crescendum
:
Aphelios

Aphelios
casts forth a lunar spotlight in the target direction that briefly grants

After 0.

Aphelios'
current
main weapon
will launch from the sky against each locked-on target, dealing

on-hit
effects at 100% effectiveness. These attacks can
critically strike

Attacks do not apply
on-attack effects
.
The attacks always count as
projectiles
unless
Severum
is being used. The lunar spotlight, however, may always be intercepted regardless of which weapon is in play as the
main weapon
.
Due to this fact, non-
Severum
attacks will hit targets that are farther away from the center of the blast at a slightly longer delay.
Spell shield
will block
Moonlight Vigil's
initial detonation damage but does not prevent the attacks from locking-on.
All attacks from
Moonlight Vigil
critically strike
independently from each other.
This includes
Infernum's
bolts, which also critically strike independently from the primary attack's damage.
Changing weapons while
Moonlight Vigil
is in flight does not change the effect it has when it hits.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.
Moonlight Vigil's
effect radius is centered around the location of the missile as it collides.
With
Severum
, the extra flat heal is given only once, not per target. However, all damage done by
Moonlight Vigil
with it also heals him from
Severum's
own passive effect.
With
Infernum
, 14 fire bolts splash from each target hit (18 for
critical strikes
). Bolts do not activate if
Moonlight Vigil's
initial damage
kills
the target.
With
Crescendum
, 1 spectral chakram is generated for every target hit, meaning it is possible to generate up to 10 spectral chakrams with one cast of
Moonlight Vigil
if it hits 5 enemy champions.
The locked-on attacks' can be
dodged
and
blocked
, but won't be prevented if
Aphelios
is
blinded
.
Preventing the attack also prevents the additional effect (e.g. marking them with
Gravitum
or granting
spectral chakrams
).
Moonlight Vigil
has different visual effects changed accordingly to each weapon.
This may vary depending on the
skin
, this showcases the

Emerging from moonlight’s shadow with weapons drawn, Aphelios kills the enemies of his faith in brooding silence—speaking only through the certainty of his aim, and the firing of each gun. Though fueled by a poison that renders him mute, he is guided by his sister Alune in her distant temple sanctuary from where she pushes an arsenal of moonstone weapons into his hands. For as long as the moon shines overhead, Aphelios will never be alone.

Separated at primordial birth, Aphelios, a fiend of chaos, and Alune, an archoness of order, were created as enemies. Yet, drawn each night to wander by shared visions of the moon, they found each other. Abandoning their natures, they struggle to show creation that darkness can shine, even as other divinities endlessly war…

Aphelios stays quiet, preferring to worship the Bull God according to obscure “old ways” that are unfamiliar to the rest of his squad. His teammates are welcoming, if curious, but have yet to realize that Aphelios and his sister Alune are actually the Bull God's progeny, placed among the squad to face this year's Lunar Beast.

Ionians share whispered stories of the twin spirits of the night, Aphelios and Alune. It is said the darkening of the sky comes from the brother's armaments, tearing the fabric of blues and whites apart to create an obsidian canvas painted with stars. The sister's motives are more... mysterious.

A multi-instrumental musical genius whose passion for his craft is nigh obsessive, Aphelios is the composer and creative backbone of HEARTSTEEL.  Though he rarely ever speaks, with this wild band of musical misfits and his twin sister (the band's manager Alune) by his side, Aphelios is ready to have his creative voice heard loud and clear.

The Hitman and the Seer
(Innate)
Innate:
Aphelios
has access to an arsenal of 5
Moonstone Weapons
, created by his sister
Alune
. He equips two weapons at any one time, one as his
main weapon
and one as his
off-hand
. Each weapon has a unique basic attack and passive effect.
Aphelios
begins the game with
Calibrum
as his
main weapon
and
Severum
in his
off-hand
, with
Gravitum
,
Infernum
, and
Crescendum
queued in reserve. The queue order can be rearranged based on weapon usage.
Moonlight:
Weapons spawn with 50
Moonlight
for ammunition, which is consumed on basic attacks or to cast his
abilities
. Abilities that cause
Aphelios
to attack do not cost additional
Moonlight
on top of their ability cost. Once his
main weapon
is exhausted of
Moonlight
, it is moved to the end of the queue and
Aphelios
equips the next available weapon from his reserve.
Weapon Master:
Aphelios
cannot improve his abilities with skill points. He starts the game with
Phase
and gains access to
abilities
at level 2. He gains access to
Moonlight Vigil
at level 6, which improves automatically at levels 11 and 16. Instead,
Aphelios
may spend his skill points to gain
bonus
attack damage

Trivia
[

edit source
]
Aphelios
means "furthest from the sun".
[2]
It comes from
Greek
, "
apo
" means "far apart, away"
[3]
and "
Helios
" is the
Titan god
of the sun,
[4]
the latter element being shared with
Aurelion
Sol
.
In astronomy, "
aphelion
" means "the point in the orbit of an object where it is farthest from the Sun" also has the
same origin
.
His sister's name
Alune
is possibly based on
Latin
luna
, which shares the same PIE root *
lewk-
as
Lux
and
Lucian
.
[5]
Aphelios
and
Alune
are possibly inspired by the
Sun and Moon twins
from
Indo-European mythology
; albeit that
both twins
belong to the Lunari order.
Aphelios is the first champion that has less than four abilities.
A unique HUD is used due to the unorthodox arrangement of his kit.
Aphelios has a game start ceremony that forces him in place.
Aphelios is the only champion in
League of Legends
who can obtain the highest amount of
Lethality
.
Since Aphelios can hold two weapons at a time with
The Hitman and the Seer
, there are 10 different possible combinations of weapons he can have equipped. These are:
Calibrum
and
Severum
Calibrum
and
Gravitum
Calibrum
and
Infernum

Aphelios was associated with a meme known as
'200 years'
that stemmed from a champion designer's controversial
comments
regarding game design experience. Despite the comment being in response to a conversation about
Wukong
, the meme has been affiliated with Aphelios because the comment was made shortly after Aphelios's release, because Aphelios's kit was complex in both visual clarity and mechanics, and because Aphelios was extraordinarily strong during his release.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.

Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage

Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter

Luden's Companion

cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
