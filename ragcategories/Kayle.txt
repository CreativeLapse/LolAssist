Divine Ascent
Kayle
ascends through four forms that each grant additional bonuses:
Level 1 - Zealous:
Kayle's
basic attacks grant her stacking
attack speed
, and at maximum stacks she also gains
move speed
.
Level 6 - Arisen:
Kayle
gains
range
and becomes a ranged champion.
Level 11 - Aflame:
While at maximum stacks,
Kayle's
basic attacks launches a fire wave that deals
magic damage
.
Level 16 - Transcendent:
Kayle
is permanently at maximum stacks, in addition to gaining even more
range
.
Innate:
Kayle
ascends through four forms that each grant additional bonuses. She ascends upon spending a skill point at
levels
1, 6, 11, and 16.
Level 1 - Zealous:
Kayle's
basic attacks
on-attack
generate a
stack
of
Zeal
for 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and stacking up to 5 times. For each stack, she gains
6%
(+ 1% per 100 AP)
bonus
attack speed
, up to a maximum of
30%
(+ 5% per 100 AP)
. At max stacks, she becomes
Exalted
, gaining
10%
bonus
movement speed
.
Level 6 - Arisen:
Kayle
becomes
ranged
and gains
350
bonus
attack range
for a total of
525
.
Level 11 - Aflame:
Kayle
gains 10% bonus
size
. While
Kayle
is
Exalted
, her basic attacks
on-attack
also launch a
wave
of fire forward that deals
20 − 41 (based on level)
(+ 10%
bonus
AD)
(+ 25% AP)
magic damage
to all enemies it passes through. The
wave
is affected by
critical strike
modifiers.
Level 16 - Transcendent:
Kayle
gains an additional
100
bonus
attack range
for a total of
625
, and permanently gains the full effects of
Zealous
.

Zealous
The stacking
bonus
attack speed
can be tracked on the HUD via a buff called
Zeal
, while the maximum stacks bonus grants the buff
Exalted
.
Subsequent applications will also refresh the duration of all stacks, but all of them are lost when expired.
If
Kayle
is in her attack animation after the stacks expire, she gains another 0.
5
seconds to refresh/stack
Zeal
.
Each stack grants
bonus
attack speed
based on
Kayle's
ability power
at the time the stack is generated and will not update if it is changed.
For example, if a stack is generated while she has
0 ability power
, it'll grant
6% attack speed
. If she acquired
100 ability power
afterward, the next stack will grant
7%
. The 2 stacks grant a total of
13%
bonus
attack speed
and not
14%
.
Arisen
Basic attacks within
175 units
will still use
Kayle's
melee basic attack animations and do not utilize
projectiles
.
They are still classified as
ranged
attacks.
Due to this fact, projectile-blocking effects cannot intercept basic attacks while
Kayle's
target is within her "melee" range.
Aflame
On becoming
Aflame
,
Kayle's
bonus size grows linearly over 1 second.
Basic attacks against
structures
and
wards
do not trigger fire waves.
While at 4 stacks of
Zeal
, the next attack
on-attack
reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by
Aflame
, releasing the first fire wave.
Transcendent
The
Zeal
and
Exalted
buffs are replaced by a new buff that grants the benefits of both and it is not visible on
Kayle's
HUD.
This buff also updates its
attack speed
value whenever a
stat update
happens and
ability power
is changed, however, it does not track
ability power
from other buffs, unless they have been specifically special cased. The following buffs are not special cased yet and will not grant bonus
attack speed
:
Runes
(including
Adaptive Force rune shards
)
Infernal Might
Fire Waves Details
Hitboxes shows by a graph side by side.
A wave consists of three projectiles for the hitbox and a fourth for visuals.
The hitbox projectiles spawn 75 units behind
Kayle
, travel through her, and are destroyed once they've traveled 850 units. Their technical details are:
Range:
850
(755 effective)
Width:
200
Projectile Speed:
2800
Angle:
18° (left and right at 9° to their side, respectively)
Projectile
-blocking effects can block each projectile individually.
It is possible to block the visuals, but still get hit by an unblocked "invisible" hitbox projectile.
Hitting an enemy with multiple projectiles of the same wave will not increase the damage dealt.
The fire wave shares
cast instance
with the triggering basic attack.
The amount of
Conqueror
stacks gained will be
(
2
/
1
)
if the basic attack deals damage first or 2 if the wave does so.
Keep in mind that it's still two damage instances. If one triggers
Bone Plating
, the other's damage will be blocked.
Fire waves roll
critical strike chance
on each target hit individually.
The distance of the fire waves scales with
bonus
attack range.
A known issue is that despite dealing
area spell damage
the fire wave does not:
Consume
Mana Charge
from
Tear of the Goddess
and its upgrades.
Trigger
Manaflow Band
.
Interactions & Other
Because
Kayle
is both a
melee
and
ranged
champion, she can purchase both ranged and melee exclusive items at anytime, but their effects will function depending on her current range type; the same principle also applies to
runes
.
However, keep in mind that, prior to ascending to
Arisen
,
Starfire Spellblade
also changes this behaviour based on its usage.
Waves are fired in the direction that
Kayle
is facing. Changing that during the attack windup via
Flash
will also change the direction of the wave.
Each ascension has an unique animation and a voice line.
(
See: Kayle's quotes
)
The ascensions' animation will override the current one, but it does not cancel
Kayle's
current action, nor her previous orders.

Details
This ability has a cast time and cast delay. The former represents the amount of time Kayle needs to spend to cast and is equal to her attack windup time. The latter is the amount of time the portal needs to launch the sword, which is always
0.
264
seconds
seconds, starting from the beginning of the cast time.
As implied by the previous point, the portal is created at the start of the cast time and
Kayle
does not have to be alive for it to launch the sword.
The portal does not follow
Kayle's
movements, using
Flash
or getting displaced won't change its position nor direction either.
The cast time can be calculated by dividing
Kayle's
windup percent
value (0.
193555
) with her current total attack speed.
Radiant Blast's
cast time is
0.
33
seconds
at base attack speed, is at most
0.
99
seconds
at the minimum attack speed of
0.2
, and is
0.
099
seconds
at the attack speed cap of
2.5
. The cast time can be further decreased with effects that allows the player to bypass the attack speed cap.
Additionally, it should be noted that due to action only taking place on whole game ticks, the cast time can only be changed in fractions of 0.
033
seconds. This also means that the lowest possible cast time is 0.
033
seconds, requiring at least
5.8652
attack speed.
Correction:
Important to note that in patch
V9.17
,
Radiant Blast's
cast time was changed to be a flat 0.
25
seconds, rather than scaling with the attack windup time. In patch
V10.4
, this was undocumentedly changed back. Whether the change to scale with windup time again was intentional or not is unknown.
The resistance reduction is applied after the damage has been dealt.
The expansion consists of 5 hitboxes, forming a cross-like shape centered 100 units ahead from the impact in its direction. Their technical details can be seen below and visualized on the image to the right.
The left side shows projectile's width and the total area traveled if it does not hit a target, while the right side shows the explosions when it hits a target.

Interactions & Other
The visual effects of the explosion shows the blade and guard of
Kayle's
swords.
The resistance reduction can be tracked on the HUD as a debuff called
Sundered
.
Correction:
Note that the
PsyOps skin still uses the old shred VFX, which also only shows for 3 seconds (effect duration is not affected). This is possibly an oversight as all existing, and at the time released Dragon Slayer, skins were updated properly in
V11.18

as normal.
Proc damage
for the passive's
on-hit
effect.
Spell damage
for the active's effect.
The damage dealt to secondary targets by the explosion is additionally tagged as
area of effect
.
The active's effect shares the same
cast instance
with the triggering attack (exception:
Muramana
, see
Interactions & Other
).
Parry interactions:
Blind
: The main target will never receive damage, but the secondary targets will receive the active's spell damage.
Block
: Blocking will always negate all damage. Keep in mind that if a secondary target is outside of
Spirit's Refuge's
zone, they won't block damage.
Dodge
: Dodging will always negate all damage.
PENDING FOR TEST:
: All parry interactions are marked for retesting because of patch
V11.1
changes.
Interactions & Other
While the active's effect is up, a circle is visible to
Kayle
, indicating her
range
, however, this circle only takes into account
Divine Ascent's
effect on her range, not other sources such as
Rapid Firecannon
.
The increased range (with the item's effect included) will be
675
prior to ascending to
Transcendent
, after which it's
725
.
To clarify the description,
Starfire Spellblade
can behave both as a
ranged
and
melee
attack based on how far the target is prior to
Kayle
ascending to
Arisen
, after which the attack will be always using ranged standards.
If the target is 200 units away or closer, the attack will be considered melee. This also uses her melee animations, not utilizing projectiles even after ascending.
If the target is over 200 units, the attack will be considered ranged.
To further expand on this: Using the ranged empowered attack will change
Kayle's
range type to ranged while the projectile is alive. This means that if the target could outrun the projectile,
Kayle
would be stuck on being ranged, although the bonuses from the active are not kept. While it's unlikely to be on this temporary ranged state for longer than half a seconds during a normal playthrough, it is possible to achieve few seconds when specific conditions are met.
Keep in mind that while on-hit effects will be applied to all targets in the explosion,
on-attack
effects are only applied once per basic attack, not per target hit.
Single-use on-hits, such as
Spellblade
, will be applied to the main target.
If the main target died prior to the projectile reaching them, or if it was a
jungle plant
, the effects will be applied to the closest target from the explosion's center.
Guinsoo's Rageblade's
Phantom Hit
can only be applied to the main target.
Despite being one cast instance,
Starfire Spellblade
triggers
Muramana's

Details
Divine Judgment's
cast time does not interrupt movement and the cast will finish even after
Kayle's
death.
Since
internalraw
damage ignores invulnerability, the target may still die via the
Nexus Obelisk
, but the ability will finish at their corpse's position regardless.
Divine Judgment
will prioritize casting on allies over
Kayle
. This means that if Kayle's and an ally's selection ranges are intercepting each other on the cursor's position, the cast will always occur on the ally.
Prior to becoming
Transcended
via
Divine Ascent
, casting
Divine Judgment
refreshes the duration of
Zeal
stacks at the start of the cast time to ensure that it does not expire while she can't attack during the cast.
During cast, an indicator for the damaging area can be seen around the target, however, this is not visible if there is no
sight
on the them.
Divine Judgment
can be cast on
clones
too, including
Shapesplitter
and
Warrior Trickster
, which are normally not targetable for allies.
While it's an uncommon occurence, it is possible to cast
Divine Judgment
on targets who just entered
resurrection
or
zombie state
. This is only possible with very strict timing and perhaps high latency.
It's recommended to avoid both of the afformentioned interactions, as they render the usage of
Divine Judgment
useless in many cases.
Interactions & Other
While the target is invulnerable, a number indicator will appear beneath them whenever they would receive damage to show the amount that was entirely mitigated. This is calculated pre-mitigation, meaning before resistances and reductions are taken into account.
Rapid Firecannon's
Energized
effect behaves strangely with the set basic attack range:
If the ability is cast while the effect is ready, the range goes from
400
to
385
over 4
stat updates
(400 -> 390 -> 387 -> 385). When the cast completes, the proper range needs 2 updates to set in (
660
-
675
while
Arisen
;
710
-
725
while
Transcended
).
Gaining the effect during the cast will cause the range to cycle between
525
and
550
until the cast finishes, then the proper range is set after 1 update.
Selling the item during the cast causes the range to be set to
250
.
PENDING FOR TEST:
Range values are outdated because of patch
V11.18
changes to
Kayle
.
The invulnerability can be tracked on the HUD via a buff called
Intervention
.

Kayle

Kayle, the Judicator
Kayle was the first to have her dance changed after release, (followed by
Veigar
) the first to have her abilities reworked three times since release, (followed by
Ryze
) and the first to use Chinese artwork outside Asian servers.
Kayle -
Morgana
is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being
Cassiopeia
-
Katarina
,
Garen
-
Lux
,
Nasus
-
Renekton
,
Yasuo
-
Yone
,
Darius
-
Draven
, and
Vi
-
Jinx
).
Though not a pair,
Anivia
,
Ornn
, and
Volibear
are also siblings.
During
Alpha Test
, she was simply called 'Judicator' and at one point she was incorrectly listed as a
tank
.
Her old dance referenced
Will Smith's
"Jump on It"
dance from
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
She shared this dance with
Singed
.
Her new dance is a reference to the dance of Elaine Benes from
Seinfeld "The Little Kicks"
.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
original icon of
Intervention
was used to represent the "Mac Client" section.

Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's
Unbreakable
,
Samira's
Blade Whirl
, and
Yasuo's
Wind Wall
can block, destroy and / or stop projectiles.
Some
ranged
basic attacks (
including
turrets
) and abilities don't use projectiles and will bypass projectile-blocking effects.
Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Cast instance
Cast instance is the identifier that tells the
source
of spells. Multiple spells, such as basic attacks and abilities, under the same cast instance behave as one for certain interactions. Some notable examples:
Conqueror's
stacking can only be triggered once per cast instance.
Electrocute
and
Phase Rush
can only receive 1 stack for their activation per cast instance.
Muramana
deals its damage once per cast instance.
Not to be confused with damage instance, which is each individual effects, even under the same cast instance.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets
.
League of Legends content
Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge

Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind
and
dodge
take precedence over
block

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable

Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
