Shauna Vayne is a deadly, remorseless Demacian monster hunter, who has dedicated her life to finding and destroying the demon that murdered her family. Armed with a wrist-mounted crossbow and a heart full of vengeance, she is only truly happy when slaying practitioners or creations of the dark arts, striking from the shadows with a flurry of silver bolts.

are currently the only champions with an ability named the same as their title (
Night Hunter

The Darkin Blade

Blade of the Ruined King
).
As per her retconned lore, Vayne hunts and kills monsters, hybrids, shape-shifters, etc. not due to any ethical guidelines, but to satisfy her bloodlust, making her resemble
Dexter Morgan
, a fictional serial killer who mostly targets other morally deplorable murderers.
Similarly, Vayne & Dexter both developed
killing urge
after witnessing their respective parents being murdered (Vayne's father & mother; Dexter's
mother
).
Vayne
,
Warwick
and
Trundle
are the only champions without damaging area-of-effect abilities.
Vayne was nearly cancelled due to her concept artist unable to properly concept her with a big hat.

Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets
.
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Invisibility
Invisibility
is a form of stealth that renders a unit hidden from enemy
vision
for a
short
period of time. It can be utilized to sneak in on opponents as well as the ability to reposition in-combat or simply to flee from a skirmish. It also grants
ghosting
.
Invisible
units can
only
be revealed by
True Sight
.
Stealthed
units shimmer their character model for 0.
6
seconds whenever they take damage.
A unit will shimmer for every instance of damage they take, and shimmering does not make the unit targetable nor remove the
stealth
effect, but grants positional information to the enemy.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Ward
Wards
are deployable units that that grant
sight
over the surrounding area. They can only be destroyed by
basic attacks
, granting
gold

experience
.
There are three kinds of deployable
wards
available for purchase:
Control Ward
,
Warding Totem
, and
Farsight Alteration

Zombie Ward
, are usable through various means.

Stasis
A unit that is in
stasis
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use
any
summoner spell
for the duration, while also being
invulnerable
and
untargetable
.
Stasis
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), all
channeled and charged
abilities and all
dashes
and
displacements
. Units that are being
knocked up
will be placed on the ground, but aren't
knocked down
(the
airborne
status is not removed in this case).
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Epic monsters
and
turrets
are special cased to be affected by
stasis
despite them being
crowd control immune
.
Removal:
Cannot be removed by any means (except through
death
), and will prevent the activation of abilities that would usually remove
crowd control
effects.
Quicksilver
will either be placed on a short cooldown, remain usable, or become disabled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
