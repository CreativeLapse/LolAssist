Wither
interrupts the target's
attack windup
when it is first applied.
(bug)
If
Wither's
duration is affected by
Tenacity
the effects will apply slower (negative tenacity percentage) or faster (positive tenacity percentage) so the maximum values are still reached when the modified duration ends.
Wither's
cripple effectiveness calculates from its slow's base values, thus
slow resist
will not interact with the attack speed modifier indirectly.
Both
slow
and
cripple
from
Wither
are considered to be a single
debuff
.
(note)
Therefore,
slow immunity
will prevent both, even without technical
cripple immunity
.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on

Nasus is an imposing, jackal-headed Ascended being from ancient Shurima, a heroic figure regarded as a demigod by the people of the desert. Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian of knowledge and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the ancient empire of Shurima to greatness for many centuries. After the fall of the empire, he went into self-imposed exile, becoming little more than a legend. Now that the ancient city of Shurima has risen once more, he has returned, determined to ensure it never falls again.

Yet now, with his heart opened to the power of disco, he leads his people in rebellion against the deadly shock troopers Blitz & Crank.

Nasus is Strike Team Hyperion's intelligence officer. His exosuit, the S02-Anubis, is a new model of power armor that offers increased durability, energy-siphoning power cells, and access to in-depth analysis tech for processing mission-critical information. He will see Hyperion succeed; if they don't, there's no telling what destruction rogue exo-pilots may wreak.

Before, he was content to act without reason in pursuit of chaos, but now, he enjoys finding weaknesses and dismantling them for total havoc. Cause for maximum effect.

]
Original Nasus
Nasus
literally means "nose" in Latin - referencing his
golden wolf
head's long nose.
During development he was simply called
Anubis Head
or '
Ammon
' "hidden, unseen".
[2]
He was voiced by Gene McDaniels.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
original icon of
Fury of the Sands
was used to represent the "Player Concepts" and "Champion Feedback" sections.
Nasus, The Curator of the Sands
Following the death of his original voice actor, he is voiced by
Erik Todd Dellums
in both
League of Legends
and
Legends of Runeterra
.
Dellums also voices Nasus in
Shurima: Descent into the Tomb
and
Rise of the Ascended
.
Infernal Nasus
is voiced by the same voice actor.
Nasus
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bard
,
Bel'Veth
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
,
Thresh
, and
Veigar
.
In Nasus' case,
Siphoning Strike
infinitely stacks the bonus
physical damage
of itself.
Nasus -
Renekton
is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being
Cassiopeia
-
Katarina
,
Kayle
-
Morgana
,
Garen
-
Lux
,
Yasuo
-
Yone
,
Darius
-
Draven
, and
Vi
-
Jinx
).
Though not a pair,
Anivia
,
Ornn
, and
Volibear
are also siblings.
Nasus is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses
Fury of the Sands
.
Four other champions with this feature are
LeBlanc
(via
Mirror Image
),
Shaco's
(via
Hallucinate
),
Wukong
(via
Warrior Trickster
) and
Malphite

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends

minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp

Turret
A
turret
, also called a

critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Persistent area damage
Persistent area damage
is technically not a separate type of damage, but rather a hybrid classification that is applied to some spells.
In situations where
persistent damage
and
area damage
would have conflicting outputs, the conflict is resolved by choosing the weakest possible outcome.
Physical vamp
and
Spell vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness, as with
area damage
.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 5%, as with
persistent damage
, per target affected.
Counter Strike
reduces the damage dealt by 25%, as with
area damage
.
