Time in a Bottle
STATIC COOLDOWN
:
120
TARGET RANGE:
875
Innate:
Zilean
generates a storage of
experience
over time. When he has enough to level up an allied
champion
, he can
channel
by
selecting them to split the stored
experience
between himself and the ally.
Innate:
Zilean
generates
2 / 3.
5
/ 5 / 6 / 12 (based on level)
experience
(does not count towards his own
level up
) every 5 seconds.
Time in a Bottle
is on cooldown when the game starts and becomes disabled when everyone on
Zilean's
team including himself has reached level 18.
When he has stored enough to level up an allied
champion
and grant the same amount of experience to himself, he can
select them
to
channel
for 1.
2
seconds after a 0.
5
-second
cast time
. The channel is
interrupted
and disabled upon entering
combat
with enemy champions or taking damage from
turrets
, placing it on a
10-second cooldown
. If
Zilean
interrupts it himself, it is placed on a 1-second cooldown, increased to 2 if he used a
basic attack
against a turret to do so.
A successful channel will grant an equal amount of
experience
to the ally to-level-up and
Zilean
, with a combined minimum of 15% his stored
experience
.
Info
Targeting input

Interrupted
Zilean
has a hidden passive that grants him
1 ability power
for every enemy
Volibear
within 800 range of him.
Likewise,
Volibear
gains
1 armor
for every nearby
Zilean
.
Neither
Volibear
nor
Zilean
need
sight
of one another to gain these bonuses.
Time in a Bottle
marks allied champions with two circles beneath them; the inner one represents how close they are to leveling up, turning golden when able to activate
Time in a Bottle
on them.
The target allied champion is not required to be out of combat to be leveled up by
Time in a Bottle
- only
Zilean
is.
Zilean
only consumes the amount of
experience
required to level up an allied champion. He retains the excess for later use.
The target allied champion is not required to be within range of
Zilean
for the channel to complete successfully, it will complete regardless of if they move to a far distance.
The channel from
Time in a Bottle
is not interrupted even if the allied champion suddenly levels up. However, no experience will be granted to either player, and the passive will not go on cooldown.

Once a powerful Icathian mage, Zilean became obsessed with the passage of time after witnessing his homeland’s destruction by the Void. Unable to spare even a minute to grieve the catastrophic loss, he called upon ancient temporal magic to divine all possible outcomes. Having become functionally immortal, Zilean now drifts through the past, present, and future, bending and warping the flow of time around him, always searching for that elusive moment that will turn back the clock and undo Icathia’s destruction.

Though many Santas compete to give the most holiday cheer, Zilean's mastery over the flow of time lets him deliver huge numbers of presents in an instant. So far this has not created a reality-annihilating Snowdown paradox.

Consistently in a near-comatose state from peering across the space-time continuum, Zilean's more recent hobbies include being terrible at hacky-sack, paying way too much for a ticket for awful music festivals, and ordering too many pizzas. He also owns New Age bookstore, which is closed most days.

Sage Zilean bowed his head in supplication as he took the Hunter's place before the Aurora's judge. His request was for more power to help calm the spirits of his followers. As he talked, he was oblivious to the Aurora sheen of Polaris' hair flickering red as she watched his pronounced humility. Something was stirring inside her, a roiling winter storm.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends
. Each champion possesses unique abilities and
attributes
.
League of Legends content
Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt
)
Silence
(
Disrupt

Interrupt
Interrupt
is a quality of crowd control that
interrupts
an in-progress effect, preventing its completion or causing the effect to go off at an
interrupted
state.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Standard sight
Standard sight
reveals units through
fog of war
and
brush
, but
not
stealth
. It does not bypass
nearsight
effects.

Stun
A unit that is
stunned
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
for the duration.
Stun
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
) and all
channeled and charged
abilities.
Reduction:
The

Cleanses
.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects. Entering
resurrection
does not cancel cast times.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet
,
Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
