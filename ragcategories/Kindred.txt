The champion
Kindred
consists of two entities:
Lamb
is the primary one answering movement commands and performing
basic attacks
.
Wolf
is the secondary one acting as an
untargetable
companion
commanded through abilities.

Mark of the Kindred
TARGET IMMUNITY
:
240
Innate:
Both
Lamb
and
Wolf
mark targets to
hunt
. Scoring a
takedown
against a
hunted
target collects a permanent stack of
Mark of the Kindred
.
Lamb
can select an enemy
champion
to
hunt
, and
Wolf
automatically selects a large
monster
to
hunt
.
Mark of the Kindred:
Lamb
gains
bonus
range
on her basic attacks and
Mounting Dread
. For each stack,
Kindred's
abilities become more potent.

Mark of the Kindred:
Lamb
gains
75 − 250 (based on marks)
bonus
range
on her basic attacks and
Mounting Dread
.
Innate - Lamb:
Lamb
is offered a selection of enemy
champions
to
hunt
if she has not been
in combat
with them in the last 6 seconds. Once selected, the mark is applied after an 8-second delay and thereafter it can be collected by
Kindred
.
Lamb
gains the ability to select a new target every 75 seconds.
Targets successfully hunted cannot be marked again for 4 minutes.
Innate - Wolf:
Starting at
3:15
,
Wolf
periodically marks a random large
monster
within the enemy team's jungle for 180 seconds. The
hunted
camp is highlighted on the
mini map
to both teams. Once the
hunted
target is slain or the mark expires,
Wolf
will wait 45 seconds before selecting a new target.
The type of monster that
Wolf
can mark changes based on
Kindred's
current

Info
Targeting input
Passive
Takedowns
on
monsters
occur if
Kindred
had damaged them within the last 6 seconds.
This only includes if the monster was slain by
Kindred
or an ally.
Only killing the large monster is required to claim
Wolf's
mark.
Gaining stacks from champions that would change what constitutes as a valid target for
Wolf
will not affect
Kindred's
ability to claim
Wolf's
current target.
Wolf
cannot mark monsters that have been slain, even if
Kindred's
team doesn't know that the camp has been slain.
Wolf's
cooldown is not displayed in-game. Combined with the above point and the target restrictions,
Wolf
may go extended periods of time without seeming to do anything.
Wolf's
marked target will always have its mark removed from the map 15 seconds after dying for both teams, regardless of whether they have vision of it or not.

Separate, but never parted, Kindred represents the twin essences of death. Lamb’s bow offers a swift release from the mortal realm for those who accept their fate. Wolf hunts down those who run from their end, delivering violent finality within his crushing jaws. Though interpretations of Kindred’s nature vary across Runeterra, every mortal must choose the true face of their death.

When the Ashen Lord rose, high priests of the Shadowfire Temple called upon their own god to fend off the all-consuming Infernals. They neglected, however, to account for the being's twin aspects: Destruction, and Rebirth. Kindred will fight the flames, but there may be a bitter price to pay before the end…

Lamb joined the Super Galaxy team as its lead scout, venturing into uncharted territory to face all manner of alien dangers. Soon after, Wolf joined the team as Lamb's partner—though, in truth, he only really joined because she still owes him for lunch, back when they were cadets. She's not getting away this time!

Once a skilled hunter and her fierce hound, the two were so bonded that their souls remained together when they were preserved inside the Dog Zodiac Relic.

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
Kindred
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bard
,
Bel'Veth
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Nasus
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
,
Thresh
, and
Veigar
.
In Kindred's case,
Mark of the Kindred
infinitely stacks the bonus
attack speed
of
Dance of Arrows
,
magic damage
of
Wolf's Frenzy
and
bonus physical damage
of
Mounting Dread
.
Kindred is the first champion to not have their icon derived from their artwork (considering theirs is a two-for-one case) as well as the first whose release was celebrated with
summoner icons
(one for
Lamb and one for
Wolf).
Kindred's dance references
the 'Cups' tap dance performed by Christopher Rice.

A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
In the classic splash art,
Lamb's hand has 4 fingers (with a possible hidden thumb) while in-game and in
Super Galaxy Kindred's
splash art she has 3 fingers.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Mana
Mana
(also known as

mana regeneration

items
,
runes

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.

Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are

League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings

Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

acquisition range

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets
.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
