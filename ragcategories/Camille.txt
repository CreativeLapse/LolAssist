Adaptive Defenses
STATIC COOLDOWN
:
18 / 14 / 10 (based on level)
Innate:
Periodically,
Camille's
next basic attack against a champion will
on-hit
grant her a
shield
against their damage type (
physical
or
magical
) for a short time.
Innate:
Periodically,
Camille's
next
basic attack
on-hit
against an enemy champion grants her a
shield
equal to
20% of her
maximum
health
, lasting for 2 seconds and absorbing damage from either exclusively
physical damage
or
magic damage
, based on which type the target has previously dealt most of against champions as well as on
Camille's
current
armor
and
magic resistance
.
"Adapt or perish."
Info
Targeting input
Passive
Damage type
Type
Adaptive Defenses
goes on cooldown after the shield expires or is destroyed.
The shield-typing is determined based on the
total
damage the target has dealt to champions that game (as a percentage) versus
Camille's
current
armor
and
magic resistance
.
For example, with little
bonus
resistances
Camille
would likely gain the most obvious shield-typing - i.e.
physical shield
versus champions primarily dealing
physical damage
and
magic shield
versus champions primarily dealing
magic damage
. However, if she has a sufficient amount of
armor
against a champion dealing both alternates of
physical damage
and
magic damage
, she will receive a magic shield as the
physical damage
threat is already being mitigated by her
armor
, and vice versa.
The type of shield that will be granted to
Camille
when she attacks any one enemy champion is shown as an icon beneath their
health bar
:
orange
for physical shield and
blue
for magic shield.
Adaptive Defenses
takes priority over all other
shields
except
Black Shield
.
Adaptive Defenses
Will not grant
Camille
the shield is the attack is
dodged
,
blocked
, or if she is
blinded

Precision Protocol
can be recast for a short time, dealing significantly increased damage if
Camille
delays the recast. A portion of the attack's damage will be dealt as

After 0.

seconds,
Precision Protocol
can then be recast within the next 3.
5
seconds at no additional cost.
Recast:
Camille
mimics the first cast's effects. If
Precision Protocol
is recast after 1.
5
seconds of the first attack, then the
bonus
damage is doubled, and
40% − 100% (based on level)
of the attack's
total
damage will be dealt as
true damage
.
Increased Mixed Damage:
40 / 50 / 60 / 70 / 80% AD
Both casts of Precision Protocol
reset
Camille's
basic attack timer.
Camille
is able to cast
Tactical Sweep

Both casts count as ability activations for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Both enhanced attacks
cannot
critically strike
.
The 1.
5
-second delay is "fuzzy", meaning it may take up to another 0.
25
seconds to ready the window for the empowered attack.
This syncs up perfectly with
Sheen's
cooldown between casts at 0
item haste
, which is also "fuzzy".
The second attack will also become empowered if it simply starts after the 1.
5
-second delay, even if the recast was consumed earlier.
The empowered

's
true damage
:
Has a special case to factor
Spellblade
into the true damage conversion of part of her attack's damage.
Other
on-hit
effects do not interact with the true damage conversion.
Is not amplified by modifiers that do not increase true damage such as
Coup de Grace
.
Randomly dependent on buff order, if
Plated Steelcaps
applies first before the conversion, then the resulting damage will be reduced, otherwise if the conversion happens first, then the damage will not be successively reduced (both effects are pre-mitigation on-take-damage events).
(bug)
Is dealt just prior to the physical damage portion of the attack.
Precision Protocol
applies to
structures
but the recast does not convert to true damage.
The enhanced attack will still complete and hit the target even if they become
untargetable
during the
attack's windup
.
Warden's Mail's
flat damage reduction is reduced on the second cast, reducing the physical damage but not the true damage.

Camille
can move during the delay, but the hitbox and
Camille's
visuals are fixed to the initial target direction.
Camille's
facing-direction, for effects such as
Petrifying Gaze
, is the direction she is moving, and not the direction the model is facing.
The 50% damage reduction against non-epic monsters applies after the cap. Because of this, the actual cap against non-epic monsters is 150 damage.
Because the increased damage in the outer range of the cone is dealt as an
additional
instance of damage (as opposed to
bonus
damage to the original instance), it will trigger effects twice such as being reduced by
Bone Plating
an extra time.
(note)
It still belongs to the same
cast instance
, therefore it does not trigger additional stacks of
Conqueror
or
Electrocute

Weaponized to operate outside the boundaries of the law, Camille is the Principal Intelligencer of Clan Ferros—an elegant and elite agent who ensures the Piltover machine and its Zaunite underbelly runs smoothly. Adaptable and precise, she views sloppy technique as an embarrassment that must be put to order. With a mind as sharp as the blades she bears, Camille's pursuit of superiority through hextech body augmentation has left many to wonder if she is now more machine than woman.

As Senna continued her search, the bitter Camille pursued her with simmering rage. She was an elegant but ruthless dancer who ran afoul of a previous Polaris and was punished for it, enough so to lose her legs. Wielding newly empowered limbs, she ambushed Senna and summoned her compatriots, Sylas and Thresh. The Aurora thieves had arrived.

Trivia
[

|

]
Camille
is one of 21 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Aatrox
,
Darius
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Draven
,
Garen
,
K'Sante

Kayn

Riven
,
Samira
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Urgot
,
Xayah
,
Yone
, and
Zed
.
Camille was the last champion released in
2016
, designed to make players 'feel like in-control badasses'.
Her design bears a very strong resemblance to ​​​​Lin Beifong from the series
Legend of Korra
, with similar appearance, profession, and fighting style. She may have also been influenced by Gazelle from the movie
Kingsman: The Secret Service
.
Camille's passive is so far the only instance of a shield that exclusively protects from physical damage.
Camille
is the French derivative of Latin
Camilla
, feminine form of
cognomen
Camillus
.
Camillus/a
means 'temple attendant,' and has no Latin root. Earlier forms include Greek
Κάδμος
-Κάμιλλος-Κᾰσμῖλος-Κᾰδμῖλος, loaned from Pre-Greek
*Hatʸmilʸ-
.
[2]
The name Camille could also be a reference to the mythological warrior
Camilla
who appears in the second half of Vergil's Aeneid on the side of the
Rutulians
. She is a warrior virgin queen of the
Volsci
and serves under the goddess Diana. She was said to be so swift-footed she could run through a wheat field without breaking the tops of the stalks and run across the ocean without wetting her feet.
Her clan's name
Ferros
probably references the Latin word for iron
ferrum
"
iron
".
[3]
Her dance references the
Airflare
, a
breakdance move
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
She shares this dance with
Kennen
.
Her dance is very similar to
PROJECT: Vayne's
, whose dance is a similar breakdance move.
A side-by-side comparison of her and
PROJECT: Vayne's
dances can be seen
here.
She was first mentioned in pre-rework
Evelynn's
color story
The Shadows Beckon
which is no longer canon.

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Top
Within a
drafted team
, the
Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts
,
Divers
,
Battlemages
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Top Lane
position.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water

Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades

stack

attack resets

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity

The
strength
