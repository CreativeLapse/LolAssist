range and speed scale 1:1 alongside any

modifiers to
Tahm Kench
, but will not be reduced
below
their base values if his overall size modifier is smaller than 100%.
As the missile range and speed scale simultaneously,
Tongue Lash
will always take
0.
33
seconds
to reach its maximum range (no matter the cast range).
Because of this, increasing
Tahm Kench's
size with items such as
Elixir of Iron
allows him to hit targets at even the same distance more quickly and giving them less time to dodge.
Devour
can be 'queued' at any point during
Tongue Lash
(including the wind-up animation) and will not go on cooldown if
Tahm Kench
fails to hit a valid target with

Grey health
can temporarily exceed 100% of his missing health when

Known by many names throughout history, the demon Tahm Kench travels the waterways of Runeterra, feeding his insatiable appetite with the misery of others. Though he may appear singularly charming and proud, he swaggers through the physical realm like a vagabond in search of unsuspecting prey. His lashing tongue can stun even a heavily armored warrior from a dozen paces, and to fall into his rumbling belly is to tumble into an abyss from which there is little hope of return.

Craving the smell of coins over all other earthly delights, Tahm Kench rises from his river kingdom each Lunar Revel, seeking to barter with mortals. Though his targets are almost always left destitute, with the proper reverence and careful wording it is possible to escape his bargains unimaginably wealthy.

The epitome of power and opulence, Tahm Kench's power drips from his tongue. Its ornate patterns captivate and cajole his listeners. He leverages those he rules, staking his power to ensure the patterns always shift in his favor—“correcting” his subjects who have gone astray.

Tahm Kench is a magnanimous devil: happy to lend a magical sword to a lady in need, or to assist her in robbing the Sulfur Rail, or even to deliver her to a calamitous destiny as a fellow Harbinger of the End Times. He don't need no compensation. She'll just owe him a favor… because in the End, it pays to have friends.

Once a catfish, Tahm Kench dreamed of becoming a dragon. Upon Jhin's release from his waterfall prison, a magical pearl was unearthed at its base, catching both Tahm's and Kog'Maw's eyes. Snatching it first, Tahm transformed into a dragon god of currents and unleashed a maelstrom of startling ferocity, laughing at the ensuing destruction.

An Acquired Taste
Innate:
Tahm Kench's basic attacks and damaging spells apply stacks of An Acquired Taste to enemy champions. At three stacks, Tongue Lash and Devour become empowered against that champion.
Tongue Lash
Active:
Damage the first enemy hit for 80/115/150/185/220 (+.7 AP) magic damage and slow them by 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70% for 2 seconds. Champions with 3 stacks of An Acquired Taste will additionally be stunned for 1.5 seconds. Activate Devour while your tongue is in mid-air to devour monsters/minions from a distance.
Target Range:
800.
Mana Cost:
50.
Cooldown:
6 seconds.
Devour
Active:
Tahm Kench devours a target for 4/4.5/5/5.5/6s (half that for enemy champions.) Enemies are dealt 20 / 23 / 26 / 29 / 32% (+.02 AP)% of their maximum health as magic damage. (maximum of 400/450/500/550/600 against neutral monsters).
Enemy Champions: Requires 3 stacks of An Acquired Taste to be devoured. While holding an enemy champion, Tahm Kench is slowed by 95%
Allied Champions: While holding an allied champion, Tahm Kench gains 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% movement speed toward enemy champions (halved when not moving toward enemy champions).
Minions and monsters: Reactivate to spit, dealing 100/150/200/250/300 (+0.6 AP) magic damage to targets hit.
Target Range:
250.
Mana Cost:
90.
Cooldown:
14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 seconds.

Active:
Convert all of your grey health into a shield that lasts 6 seconds, but falls off gradually over that time.
Mana Cost:
50.
Cooldown:
16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 seconds.
Abyssal Voyage
Passive:
Tahm Kench's basic attacks and damaging spells deal an additional (20 + 4/5/6% of Tahm Kench's bonus health) magic damage
Active:
Tahm Kench's begins to channel for up to 15 seconds. During this time, one ally champion can right click Tahm Kench to join in. Alternatively, reactivate this ability to travel alone.

Target Range:
5000/5500/6000.
Mana Cost:
100.
Cooldown:
160 / 130 / 100 seconds.
Trivia
[

edit source
]
Tahm Kench is one of the few champions who can apply crowd control on themselves (the others being
Blitzcrank
,
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Sion
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Vel'Koz
,
Xerath
, and
Ziggs
).
At first it was thought the gambler and his bride were
Tobias
and
Evelynn
(
Twisted Fate's
cards went blank and featured an unknown cursive script in his official champion page; however,
Twisted Fate
and the original
Tahm Kench
, whose identity the malevolent River King usurped, are not the same.
[2]
Tahm Kench's dance has him play the tune he hums in 'The River King' with his tongue (
Rift Scuttler
will join him if he dances near her).
Tahm Kench's design and playstyle may be loosely based on the Banderhobb, a toad-like creature from the Forgotten Realms universe which kidnaps unsuspecting victims by swallowing them alive and carrying them to its master's lair.
In
VALORANT
on the
Ascent
map (Mid Bottom), there is a park bench crafted with his likeness. This is most likely a reference to the "Unbench the Kench" meme.

Warden
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
Wardens
are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters

Catchers

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt
)
Silence
(
Disrupt
,
Polymorph
)
Sleep
Stasis
Stun

Blink
A
blink
refers to a form of movement whereby a unit displaces from point A to B without traversing the space between.
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Vanish
In addition to granting
untargetability
,
vanish
briefly hides a unit from the game's renderer, which causes it to become completely undetectable and invisible even to effects such as
Oracle Lens
.
Vanished
units are
unable to act
. As with all untargetability,
tethers
will still persist on a target that
vanishes
.
Vanish
is not considered
stealth
and does not interact with
sight
effects.
