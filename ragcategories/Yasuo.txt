Active:
Yasuo
thrusts his sword in a line in the target direction that deals
physical damage
to enemies hit and applies
on-hit
and

effects to the first enemy hit. This can
critically strike
. If this hits an enemy,
Yasuo
generates a stack of
Gathering Storm
for a few seconds. At 2 stacks, the next
Steel Tempest
consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect. If
Steel Tempest
is cast during
Sweeping Blade
, it instead affects enemies around
Yasuo
.

If this hits at least one enemy,
Yasuo
generates a
stack
of
Gathering Storm
for 6 seconds, stacking up to 2 times and refreshing on subsequent hits. At 2 stacks, the next
Steel Tempest
consumes them all to become empowered with a new effect.

If

Casting

when Steel Tempest's remaining cooldown is less than 0.
5
seconds resets this remaining cooldown to allow casting it in combination, but adds the refunded time to the cooldown of that cast. If
Yasuo
becomes unable to cast abilities during the dash after buffering, Steel Tempest will not cast, but will still go on cooldown.
(note)
The one
Gathering Storm
stack is named
Steel Wind Rising
.
The whirlwind from consuming stacks of
Gathering Storm
can strike targets whose center is behind
Yasuo
, unlike most
missiles
.
The whirlwind is not released when cast during
Sweeping Blade
, but instead
knocks up
all enemies hit around
Yasuo
at the end of the dash.
Steel Tempest
applies
basic damage
to the first (closest) enemy hit and
area damage
to secondary enemies:
Steel Tempest
will apply
on-hit
effects to the first target hit, but will not do so to the secondary ones.
Steel Tempest
will not apply
spell effects
to the first target hit, but will do so to the secondary ones.
Spell vamp
will only grant
healing
from the damage dealt to secondary targets, and healing is reduced to 33% effectiveness, accordingly.
Life steal
will heal based on the damage dealt to the first target hit.
The whirlwind is a missile and can therefore be
intercepted
.
Steel Tempest
will only draw minion aggro if the first target is a champion.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Each parry has different interactions with this ability, whether it's the first target of
Steel Tempest
or the secondary one. In either case
Yasuo
still gains a stack of
Gathering Storm
and his whirlwind knock-up cannot be negated by parries:
Dodge
: both first target and secondary target
do not
take damage.
Block
: first target
does not
take damage, secondary target
does
take damage.
Blind
: both first target and secondary target
do
take damage.
Steel Tempest
rolls its
critical strikes
individually against each enemy hit.
Casting
Last Breath
during
Steel Tempest
will buffer it to cast after the cast time has completed.
However, if
Last Breath
is used on a target affected by an
airborne
source that is not
Yasuo
, it is cast immediately due to
Steel Tempest's
cast time ending prematurely.
Steel Tempest
will still cast in this case.
If
Steel Tempest
is buffered during
Sweeping Blade
and
Yasuo
uses
Recall
,
Teleport
or
Hextech Rocketbelt
,
Steel Tempest
will go on cooldown without casting. In
Protobelt's
case
Yasuo
will also need to cast a movement command after it, else
Steel Tempest
will still trigger.
If, after this effect,
Yasuo
inputs a basic attack command quickly followed by a movement command, he will cast
Steel Tempest
around him and basic attack the target at the same time.
(bug)
Steel Tempest
will not go on cooldown.
Spell shield
does not prevent a stack of
Gathering Storm
from being gained.
While at two stacks, a range indicator will be shown for the effective range of the whirlwind.
Tips & Tricks
Casting
Last Breath
while buffering
Steel Tempest
during
Sweeping Blade
will also trigger the damage
after
the
blink
, thus avoiding the
Gathering Storm
stack reset.

Last Breath
can be cast on targets
suspended
in mid-air by
Nami's
Aqua Prison's
stun
.
The wiki has adopted the term
suspension
for this unique property due to a statement by
Yasuo's
designer.
[2]
The percentage bonus armor penetration stacks multiplicatively with other sources of percentage armor penetration.
Last Breath
requires the target to be affected by
airborne
from an
enemy source
, and simultaneously that the target is not considered
cc-immune
,
displacement immune
, or
untargetable
during it.
Last Breath
cannot be cast if there are no nearby enemy champions that meet the conditions.
Attempting to cast the ability on an enemy champion that is not airborne will indicate that they "
Must Be Airborne!
"
Self-applied or allied-applied
displacements
do not allow
Last Breath
to target the champion. Those applied by the
neutral
team (e.g.
Dragon's
initial knock back)
can
be targeted.
An
indicator
will be placed towards enemy champions that meet the cast conditions within range of
Last Breath
to signify the ability can be cast.
The Hextech Ultimatum
will prevent
Yasuo
from casting
Last Breath
on an airborne enemy champion outside its borders.
Yasuo
can only do so if the airborne enemy champion is inside the zone.
Upon
Last Breath's
cast, the targets' facing directions snap to
Yasuo
. Afterwards, their facing directions shift in all other directions every 0.
25
seconds over the duration of the airborne.
The last shift snaps them to the facing direction of the second one.
On the
Nightbringer Yasuo
skin, these shifts in facing direction do not occur, but the targets' facing directions will still snap to
Yasuo
upon
Last Breath's
cast.
Yasuo
does not need
sight
of enemy champions near his target to affect them with the ability.
Even if the target is protected by
spell shield
the ability will still affect them and deal damage, but the
spell shield
will be consumed.
Last Breath
applies its damage and removes its forced movement on the target when it ends, including if it is removed early by being
cleansed
.
This is in contrast to most other effects with
airborne
, which have their forced movement linger if the disabling debuff is removed and have to be overridden by another movement spell (such as
Lucian's
Relentless Pursuit
or
Flash
).
It behaves similar to
Nami's
Aqua Prison
in this but is not considered
suspension
.
Terrain displacing abilities (e.g.
Weaver's Wall
,
Pillar of Ice
,
Volcanic Rupture
) that affect enemy champions are considered
airborne
, and will therefore interact with
Last Breath
.
While
blinking
,
Yasuo
creates an
untargetable
clone
of himself that cues a dashing animation (similar to
Sweeping Blade's
) towards the target. This unit's rules do not follow those of a
clone's
. As such, it is more alike a champion, unless special cased.
While performing
Last Breath
,
Yasuo
is
locked out
of performing actions.
The lock out will end prematurely if
Yasuo
dies as well as by the following if all targets:
Cleanse
the
knock up
.
Are too far away from
Yasuo
.
Leave
Yasuo's

An Ionian of deep resolve, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies. As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his master—unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self defense. Even after his master’s true killer was revealed, Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done, and now wanders his homeland with only the wind to guide his blade.

As enigmatic as he is skilled, Yasuo is the veteran producer all others turn to for inspiration. His beats transcend genre, painting whole universes with wild textures of sound. Notoriously selective about his collaborations, Yasuo sees True Damage as his platform to revolutionize how society experiences music.

After the global success of “GIANTS,” reclusive producer-extraordinaire Yasuo was inundated with requests. From record deals to clothing sponsorships, he turned down one after another, preferring to stay out of the limelight to focus on the simple joys of making beats. However, A Bathing Ape somehow managed to secure his attention. Now, donning golden threads to match his musical brilliance, Yasuo holds the world's ears at attention—with fans and critics alike waiting to hear his next revolutionary track.

Long ago, two brothers fought a bitter war across Ionia. Yasuo, the younger brother, was a warlord renowned for his roguish demeanor—until he was accused of crimes against the country and took up arms to defend himself. Both were fated to fall in their final duel… a lesson, perhaps, in pride and hubris.

Empowered by the Buhru during his fight against Viego of Camavor, Yasuo made an unlikely champion for the children of Nagakabouros—his obsession with past events flew in the face of everything they believed in. Yet even the mangiest sea dog has his day, and Yasuo stood against the forces of darkness, emerging triumphant.

Alone against an army, Yasuo chose to stand and fight. He blocked a narrow pass between two mountains, allowing innocents to escape the bloodshed. Wielding the truth of steel as a dance, he felled countless foes—but even he could not hold out forever. The Dragon of Truth, moved by his swordsmanship, came down from its peak to bless him...

The song of steel grew silent, and Yasuo was the last living soul on the battlefield—though he imagined he could hear the thankful murmurs of the villagers he'd protected. Wounded and dying, Yasuo produced his flute to play a last haunting elegy. The Dragon of Dreams descended from its mountaintop, moved by Yasuo's song, and offered him its power...

Displaced from his home alongside Master Yi, Yasuo now uses his Inkshadow tattoos to ride the wind between Rabadon City and the outskirts, protecting civilians seeking asylum with help from the mysterious Man of Masks. Though he gave up his freedom in exchange for power, he sees the price as penance for being unable to help those who needed it most.

Yasuo glimpsed many paths in his dreams. One saw him as an old man, alone, having strayed far from his course. He had given up ambition, family, even love, all to atone for sins he could no longer remember. This vision was not a warning, but a reminder, for Yasuo knew he could always return to his path. He only needed to find it... or let it find him.

He disappeared only to reemerge years later a battle-hardened survivalist, still wearing his original suit. He's here to warn Anima Squad that the enemy has evolved—and if they want to survive, they'll need all hands (and paws) on deck.

Trivia

]
Yasuo -
Yone
is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being
Jinx
-
Vi
,
Cassiopeia
-
Katarina
,
Kayle
-
Morgana
,
Garen
-
Lux
,
Nasus
-
Renekton
, and
Darius
-
Draven
).
Though not a pair,
Anivia
,
Ornn
, and
Volibear
are also siblings.
The flute Yasuo plays in his dance emote is most likely a
Shakuhachi
(
harmonica
for
High Noon
;
wind controller
for
PROJECT
).
His Classic 'dance' references a
performance
of this instrument.
[3]
A side by side comparison can be seen
here
.
Yasuo is the first champion to have an emote that will orient itself the same (dancing emote, facing the bottom-right of the screen), no matter what direction Yasuo was facing. Akali is the second.
The melody of his Classic dance complements
Yone's
when the two use the dance emote simultaneously. A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Yasuo's design is largely based on the Japanese
rōnin
(lit. a wanderer), a
samurai
whose masters had died or stripped of titles & lands. Many rōnin became mercenaries,
bodyguards
, or even criminals.
The length of Yasuo's sword is about that of a
tachi
or even an
ōdachi
. However, he wears it cutting edge up like the shorter
katana
.
Yasuo
[jasɯ̟ᵝo] is a Japanese masculine
given name
, rendered as 康夫 (roughly "peaceful man") in the Japanese localization.

Old Japanese
*yasu-

Way of the Wanderer's
modified critical strike chance references Samurai gameplay portrayals in video games.
For April Fools' Day
2017
, a video showcasing a joke
rework
for Yasuo was
posted
by the official
Riot Games
Twitter account.
Way of the Wanderer
was shown to have
Resolve's
shield also provide
crowd control immunity
, similar to
Morgana's
Black Shield
.
Steel Tempest's
third cast
was shown to split into three additional whirlwinds in a cone after hitting a champion, similar to
Graves'
Collateral Damage
.
Wind Wall
was shown to form a pentagon of walls, similar to
Thresh's
The Box
.
Notably, this 'protection from
projectiles
from all angles' mechanic was later implemented by
Samira's
Blade Whirl
.
Sweeping Blade
was shown to be able to target
wards
and
champion summoned units
(e.g.
Demacian Standard
).
Last Breath
was shown to be able to be recast for a seemingly infinite amount of times while the affected champion is still
airborne
.
A functional real-life replica of Yasuo's
Steel Blade
was crafted in an episode of YouTube series
Man At Arms: Reforged
.
This video can be viewed
here
.
There are also videos where the following are crafted:
Diana's
Crescent Moonblade
(
functional
)
Katarina's
Daggers
(

)
Leona's
Zenith Blade
(

Master Yi's
'Highlander' Ring Sword
(
functional
)
Poppy's
Hammer of Orlon
(
functional, but impractically wieldy
)
Ziggs'
Hexplosive Bomb
(
prop
)
At 25 August 2018, on the statement "One of my favorites", players ranked Yasuo 2nd in CN and 56th in NA. On "Fair to play against" they ranked him 23rd in CN and 137th in NA. Overall on "Gameplay, Visuals, Voice, etc.." they ranked him 1st in CN and 38th in NA.
[6]
As an
easter egg
, in Set 4 of
Teamfight Tactics
, Yasuo would flash a
Mastery 7
emote if he single-handedly defeats the enemy team as the only remaining unit. This references the community stereotype of Yasuo players loving to flash their Mastery in League of Legends matches.
A video demonstration of this can be seen
here

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.

Flow
Flow
is a resource that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
that exists in some quantity beforehand. It is represented beneath the
health bar
that is
blue
until filled, and then
white
. Unlike
Fury
and its variants, however,
Flow
is not affected by the unit's
combat status
. With only one example of
Flow
, the validity of this exception may be called into question in the future.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells

Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed

The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage

basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge

Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment

Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block

blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to

Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks

Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
