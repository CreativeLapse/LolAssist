A headstrong young vastaya of the seas, Nami was the first of the Marai tribe to leave the waves and venture onto dry land, when their ancient accord with the Targonians was broken. With no other option, she took it upon herself to complete the sacred ritual that would ensure the safety of her people. Amidst the chaos of this new age, Nami faces an uncertain future with grit and determination, using her Tidecaller staff to summon the strength of the oceans themselves.

Enchanter
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Enchanters
focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.
Examples
Janna
Sona

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Suspension
A unit that is
suspended
is
stunned
for the duration. It also pretends to be
airborne
while the stun holds (
Last Breath

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity

The
strength
is reduced by
slow resist

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Targeting forgiveness
Certain unit-targeted abilities present an accuracy-grace system called
targeting forgiveness
.
When no valid target is
directly selected
upon using the ability, it will automatically search for one within a certain
center-to-center
forgiveness radius
. If a valid target is found within the forgiveness radius, the ability will automatically acquire them and cast on them. If multiple targets are found, the nearest one to the forgiveness radius' center is chosen.
Only ally-targeted abilities may utilize this system. Not to be confused with a different, priority-based system that a few other spells (e.g.
Smite
) use.
League of Legends content
Enchantment redirection
A certain group of damaging abilities called
enchantments
or
empowerments
require interaction of an
empowerer
, with an
ally
hitting an enemy. Enchantments commonly include mark detonations or
buffs
given to allies. The credit for an applied enchantment is directed in the following ways:
Any damage dealt through the ally by the enchantment is credited to the empowerer instead of the ally. Effects that can trigger on-damage instances of the empowerer (e.g.
Summon Aery
;
Morellonomicon's
Grievous Wounds
on magic damage; etc.) will trigger and also be credited to the empowerer. For the empowerer's redirected damage only, the ally will apply the empowerer's damage modifiers (e.g.
magic penetration
).
Any unit
kill
achieved by the ally having applied the empowerer's redirected damage, is credited to the ally instead of the empowerer.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth

Zac's

Resurrection
