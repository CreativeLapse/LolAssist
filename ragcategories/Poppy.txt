SPEED:
1600
Innate:
Periodically,
Poppy
throws
her buckler as her next basic attack, which has
bonus
range
and deals
bonus
magic damage
. The buckler then falls nearby and remains for a few seconds, which she and enemy champions can step over to either retrieve or destroy it. If this attack kills the target, the buckler bounces back to Poppy instead of falling. Upon retrieving the buckler,
Poppy
shields
herself for a portion of
her
maximum
health
, lasting a short time.
Innate:
Periodically,
Poppy's
next
basic attack
is empowered to throw her buckler, gaining
350
bonus
range
and dealing
20 − 180 (based on level)
bonus
magic damage
. After it hits, the buckler then falls to a location near the target over 1 second, landing and remaining there for up to 4 seconds.
Poppy
can move over the buckler to retrieve it, gaining a
shield
for
13 / 15.
5
/ 18% (based on level)
of her
maximum
health
for 3 seconds. If the buckler kills the target, or if the target is already dead when the buckler hits it, the buckler will bounce back to
Poppy
instead of falling. Enemy
champions
can move over the buckler to destroy it.

Heroic Charge
can apply
spell effects
twice (once when
Poppy
hits her target and once she stuns them against a wall).
Both instances of damage and crowd control are all the same
cast instance
. Effects that only trigger once per spell cast will not trigger twice.
Poppy
dashes slightly less far than the distance she pushes the target.
Heroic Charge
can interact with
player-generated terrain
.
The
dash
does not follow targets. The target's position at the time of
Heroic Charge's
cast is the direction
Poppy
will dash towards.
Poppy
does not
carry
nor deal damage to the target if they have left a certain radius before she collides with them.

fountain
. Additionally, if no enemies are hit
in front
of
Poppy

The erupting hammer of the charged cast that sends out a missile will be centered on the first champion struck, not at the location the missile collided with them.
Enemies within the enemy team's fountain (at least 400 units away from the
center of the fountain
) that are hit by a
Keeper's Verdict
that would knock them back are instead
knocked up
for 0.

seconds and not rendered
untargetable
, like the uncharged effect. They still receive the full damage.
Keeper's Verdict
does not destroy in-flight
projectiles
for enemies hit if they are rendered
untargetable
.
The
knock back
will only displace enemies as far as they can go (e.g. to the furthest current spot available of
Realm of Death's
and
The Hextech Ultimatum's
borders and to the corner of the fountain).
The displacement's duration will remain unchanged regardless of if the knock back cannot achieve its full distance due to the affected target being restricted by boundaries they are unable to cross. In order for this to be possible, the speed of the knock back is decreased (based on where the actual landing point is) to match the amount of distance covered to time spent displaced.
Keeper's Verdict's
airborne
debuff is non-dispellable and thus cannot be removed by
cleansing
effects.
The debuff will remove itself automatically when the forced movement ends.

Runeterra has no shortage of valiant champions, but few are as tenacious as Poppy. Bearing the legendary hammer of Orlon, a weapon twice her size, this determined yordle has spent untold years searching in secret for the fabled 'Hero of Demacia,' said to be its rightful wielder. Until then, she dutifully charges into battle, pushing back the kingdom’s enemies with every whirling strike.

Trivia
[

edit source
]
Poppy, the Iron Ambassador
Poppy was the first
champion
released in
2010
.
Poppy is the first and so far only post-launch champion to be priced at
1350
on release (all other champions with the same price were already present when the game officially launched in October 2009).
Poppy is one of two champions that went into the weekly
champion rotation
on the day of their release. The other one is
Udyr
.
Of all champion updates in the game, Poppy has gone the longest without an update to her base splash art prior to her VGU in
2015
.
Poppy, Keeper of the Hammer
Poppy is the first champion with full facial animation.
Poppy is the first champion to receive updated splash artwork for all of her skins.
Future champion reworks/updates have since followed this tradition.
The splash art features the titular
flower
.
Poppy's theme resembles
Demacia Rising
, (
instruments used
include a
low brass
and a
flute
).
Poppy's dance references the
Grunka Lunka's
dance
from
Futurama
.
[2]
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Poppy was initially going to wear
a red scarf
as a 'heroic thing', it competed heavily with her pigtails and was deemed way too busy on her model, the scarf was trimmed down to a muffler.
Poppy's
favorite food / candy
is the
lollipop
.
Poppy finds
Yordles
'too fluffy' and disorganized, herself preferring the
orderliness
found in
Demacia
.
Poppy is the first champion to have a form of crowd control in all of her abilities.
Poppy is the first and only champion to have two skins released for the
Snowdown Showdown
event.

Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
Wardens
are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's
Unbreakable
,
Samira's
Blade Whirl
, and
Yasuo's
Wind Wall
can block, destroy and / or stop projectiles.
Some
ranged
basic attacks (
including
turrets
) and abilities don't use projectiles and will bypass projectile-blocking effects.
Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.
League of Legends content
Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
. Shield reduction effects, exclusively
Serpent's Fang
, reduce all incoming and outgoing
shields

Champion
Champions

League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Does not interrupt any actions.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Lunge
A
lunge
refers to the movement of a champion
during
an ability's cast animation (
such as short-ranged abilities
) or an empowered attack's animation (
such as empowerments that grant
bonus range
), in order to place the champion in range for a follow-up attack.
Lunge
is a movement distinct from
dashes
, primarily by not triggering effects that would otherwise interact with dashes, such as
Poppy's
Steadfast Presence
.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Stun
A unit that is
stunned
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
for the duration.
Stun
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
) and all
channeled and charged
abilities.
Reduction:

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither

cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Cast instance
Cast instance is the identifier that tells the
source
of spells. Multiple spells, such as basic attacks and abilities, under the same cast instance behave as one for certain interactions. Some notable examples:
Conqueror's
stacking can only be triggered once per cast instance.
Electrocute
and
Phase Rush
can only receive 1 stack for their activation per cast instance.
Muramana
deals its damage once per cast instance.
Not to be confused with damage instance, which is each individual effects, even under the same cast instance.
