Feathers

Innate:
Xayah's
ability casts generate three stacks of
Clean Cuts
, stacking up to five times.
Xayah's
basic attacks consume a stack to instead shoot a
Feather
that deals
the attack's damage
to the target and
physical damage
to other enemies hit.
Innate - Lover's Leap:
Xayah
and
Rakan
can join each other's
Recall
to complete together.
Innate:
Feathers
shot by
Xayah
will linger in the ground at maximum range for 6 seconds.
Innate:
Xayah's
ability
casts generate 3
stacks
of
Clean Cuts
, lasting for 8 seconds, refreshing on subsequent casts, and stacking up to 5 times.
Xayah's
basic attacks
are empowered to each consume a stack
on-attack
to instead shoot a
Feather
that deals the
attack's damage
to the primary target and
30 / 40 / 50% (based on level)
AD
physical damage
to other enemies hit, with the secondary damage also
critically striking
if the main attack does.
Innate - Lover's Leap:
If either
Xayah
or
Rakan
is channeling
Recall
, the other may move nearby and channel their own to join alongside them.
Both
reach base at the time of which the initiator's

PENDING FOR TEST:
:
Missile popping
before and after striking the primary target.
After striking their target, the attack will proceed in a line in the same direction it was already flying.
If the target is more than 1000 units from
Xayah
when the empowered attack hits them, the attack will not keep flying in a line and drop the
Feather
at their location immediately.
Unlike similar effects, the homing and line trajectories use the same missile.
All her
Feathers
on the ground will be destroyed when
Xayah
dies
, and while she is dead, missiles that are still in flight will not spawn new ones, either.
Clean Cut's
feathers will spawn even if the basic attack is
blocked
.
Clean Cut's
hit can be
dodged
by or
missed
against the primary target.
This will not prevent the missile from continuing on its path nor from dealing damage to secondary targets. The damage cannot be dodged as or missed against a secondary target.
The empowered attack will not trigger against
structures
nor
wards
.
The duration will be refreshed when starting the attack windup against them.
The number of
Clean Cuts
stacks available is represented by a
feather counter in her ammo bar, visible to the player only.

The lesser bolts count as additional sources of single target physical damage, and will apply bonus stacks of

The lesser bolts from
Runaan's Hurricane

Deadly Plumage's
bolts is 20% of the fired bolt from
Runaan's Hurricane

of the initial basic attack.
The lesser bolts deal 20% of the triggering basic attack's damage, not based on her

, the lesser bolt will also deal increased damage.
The empowered attack will not trigger against

too, but only once they've landed normally first.
Spell shield
will only block a single instance of damage.
This ability cannot be ranked at
Level
1.
The damage dealt by
Bladecaller
follows a diminishing returns formula not mentioned in the ability's description, successively reducing extra damage from feathers beyond the first.
This formula is:
For feathers <=19: Damage of one feather × (n − 0.
05
× (n − 1) ÷ 2 × n) where n stands for the number of feathers hit.
For feathers >=20: Damage of one feather × (19 − 0.
05
× (19 − 1) ÷ 2 × 19 + 0.1 × (n − 19)) where n stands for the number of feathers hit.
For example, at rank 1

Deadly and precise, Xayah is a vastayan revolutionary waging a personal war to save her people. She uses her speed, guile, and razor-sharp feather blades to cut down anyone who stands in her way. Xayah fights alongside her partner and lover, Rakan, to protect their dwindling tribe, and restore their race to her vision of its former glory.

Blaming the Star Guardians for abandoning her to die, she has taken a bitter, personal stand against them, even as doubts begin to creep in...

Yone
, and

.
Xayah's and
Rakan's
dual release is the first one since
V1.0.0.72
.
They were also the first
champions
released in
2017
.
Xayah's and Rakan's loading screens always align themselves to the rightmost side before a game starts and when picked on the same team (to mirror their shared splash art).
Xayah's and Rakan's dual recall animation is divided into three sections, an intro, a middle section, and then an outro. The whole sequence would take 8 seconds if Xayah and Rakan recalled at the exact same time, while the intro and the outro are both (<2 seconds).
The system will always play the intro, then it will always play the outro when there is 2 seconds left in the animation, regardless of how long the middle section has played for. This means that the characters will blend from whatever position they are in, to the first pose of the outro part of the sequence.

Xayah does not lay eggs.

Xayah is the sixth dark-theme Ionian champion, the others being
Shen
,
Varus
,
Syndra
,
Zed
,
Jhin
, &
Kayn
.
Bladecaller's victim
is an acolyte of
The Shadow Order
.
She has a base size of 35 which is considered small.
Xayah
and Rakan are likely to always receive skins together.
iG Rakan
however, is one exception.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

League of Legends content
Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's
Unbreakable
,
Samira's
Blade Whirl
, and
Yasuo's
Wind Wall
can block, destroy and / or stop projectiles.
Some
ranged
basic attacks (
including
turrets
) and abilities don't use projectiles and will bypass projectile-blocking effects.
Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.
League of Legends content
Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall
or
Blade Whirl
(usually vanishing without any effect).
The following abilities perform one or more
projectile popping events
:
Most
abilities and effects that grant
untargetability
pop projectiles when the unit gains the status effect.
Master Yi's
Alpha Strike
in particular pops targeted projectiles on each game tick for its duration.
Gwen's
Hallowed Mist
pops all projectiles (from enemy champions outside of its area of effect) targeted at her that attempt to pass through or be inside its area of effect.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
