Concussive Blows
TARGET IMMUNITY
:
8 / 6 / 4 (based on level)
Innate:
Braum's
basic attacks and
Winter's Bite
apply a stack of
Concussive Blows
. Once the first stack is applied, allied champion
basic attacks
can also stack
Concussive Blows
. At maximum stacks, the target is
stunned
and takes
magic damage
. For the next few seconds they cannot receive new stacks, but take bonus
magic damage
from
Braum's
basic attacks.
Innate:
Braum's
basic attacks
and
Winter's Bite
each apply a
stack
of
Concussive Blows
to their target for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 4 times. Once the first stack has been applied, any allied
champion's
basic attack applies an additional stack to the target
on-hit
.
The fourth stack against a target consumes them all to deal

Direction
Definitions
Incoming:
Damage sources coming from somewhere facing the shield. Those coming from different sides are not affected.
Projectiles:
Sped up entities not classified as a unit (
champions
,
minions
,
monsters
, etc.)
Intercepting:
A projectile hitting
Braum
because he is standing in front of the intended target. In addition to being redirected, an intercepted projectile is also destroyed
after
hitting
Braum
(although this is only applicable to pass-through projectiles).
Unbreakable's
full damage reduction can block multiple instances of damage if they're dealt at the same time.
Moving units do not count for being blocked by
Unbreakable
.
Champion summoned units
are not classified as units until they hit the ground (e.g.
Sapling Toss
) and thus will interact with
Unbreakable
whilst en route.
Projectiles whose effects trigger on collision will still trigger - dealing damage, applying
debuffs
, creating area of effects and marking the target as 'hit'.
Projectiles that create an
area of effect
upon their collision will still affect other units and not only
Braum
.
Projectiles that
cannot
hit
Braum
or his allies (such as an enemy
Prismatic Barrier
) will not be intercepted.
[2]
Soraka's
Starcall's
Rejuvenation
projectile is however blocked.
The
damage reduction
will affect any source of damage whose origin is in front of the shield. This includes:
All intercepted projectiles.
Melee
and non-projectile-based
ranged
attacks.
Instantaneous
direction-targeted
abilities (e.g.
Arcanopulse
,
Final Spark
,
Lifeform Disintegration Ray
.)
Instantaneously-placed
ground-targeted
abilities (e.g.
Lay Waste
,
Pillar of Flame
,
Rupture
) relative to the ability's center and
not
the caster's.
Point-blank area-of-effects (e.g.
Ground Slam
,
Tantrum
,
Time Bomb
not
targeted at
Braum
)
Instantaneous targeted abilities (e.g.
Malefic Visions
,
Transfusion
,
Time Bomb
targeted at
Braum
) and
AoE DoT
(e.g.
Spirit Fire
,
Tormented Shadow
,
Poison Trail
).
The damage reduction only benefits
Braum
.
Damage over time
is calculated per tick but the full damage reduction will still only apply to a single tick.
If the damage mitigated by
Unbreakable
exceeds a minimum threshold it is represented with floating text similar to the damage mitigated by shields ('
-X
')
This floating text is always shown for the single fully-reduced damage source.
Braum's
facing direction is in the direction he's moving in.
If
Braum
is protected by a
spell shield
, both it and the one-time-use full damage reduction can be consumed by a single blockable spell.
The one-time-use full damage reduction will not be consumed if the damage source is nothing but
true damage
.
Unbreakable
will grant
assist
credit if the enemy whose damaging projectile is blocked from is killed within 10 seconds.

Blessed with massive biceps and an even bigger heart, Braum is a beloved hero of the Freljord. Every mead hall north of Frostheld toasts his legendary strength, said to have felled a forest of oaks in a single night, and punched an entire mountain into rubble. Bearing an enchanted vault door as his shield, Braum roams the frozen north sporting a mustachioed smile as big as his muscles—a true friend to all those in need.

Dragonslayers first rose to battle their ancient foes hundreds of years ago, and after their victory, the land fell into a long, forgetful peace. When the dragons returned, most of the ancient warriors had passed away, leaving Braum to take up their task with only his mighty shield to defend the innocent.

The strongest, bravest knight in all the land, people love Braum Lionheart and his daring tales of adventure! He's definitely not a stickler for 7th-edition Riftquest rules, and there are certainly not snax stains on his character sheet. That would be unbecoming of such a gallant warrior.

]
Braum is the first champion to feature a unique attack animation against turrets.
He is also the second to feature two joke animations, the first being
Heimerdinger
.
Braum's dance resembles the
Ukrainian Cossack dance.
Braum
(as pronounced by his voice-actor: /bɹɔ:m/) is the American variant of German surname
Brahm
[3]
/bɹɑ:mz/)
, originating either from:
Proto-Germanic
*bremaz
"prickly bush,
blackberry
" >
Middle High German
brame
,
Low Saxon
Braam
, English:
broom
(also
*bremilaz
> English
bramble
), or
reduction of Hebrew
Abram
אַבְרָם, from Semitic *
ʔab
"father"
[4]
&
*r-w-m ~ *r-y-m
"high".
[5]
Braum strongly resembles the figure in the old
Juggernaut
mastery.
When Braum feeds a
Poro
a
Poro-Snax
they will grow a mustache, with the color being determined by which skin he is using.

Warden
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
Wardens
are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less

large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution

Phantom Undertow
).

A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Targeting forgiveness
Certain unit-targeted abilities present an accuracy-grace system called
targeting forgiveness
.
When no valid target is
directly selected
upon using the ability, it will automatically search for one within a certain
center-to-center
forgiveness radius
. If a valid target is found within the forgiveness radius, the ability will automatically acquire them and cast on them. If multiple targets are found, the nearest one to the forgiveness radius' center is chosen.
Only ally-targeted abilities may utilize this system. Not to be confused with a different, priority-based system that a few other spells (e.g.
Smite
) use.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.
