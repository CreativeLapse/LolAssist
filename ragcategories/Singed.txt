Targets already with the DoT can have the debuff refreshed only every 0.

Due to the inconsistent offset between the first and future ticks is it possible for a static target to miss out on one refresh of the debuff, equal to 3 ticks of damage.
If
Singed
has moved less than 90 units since spawning the last poison cloud, it will spawn 35 units in front of him. They also only spawn every 1 second in this case.
When
Singed
is moving faster than that, the poison clouds spawn more frequently and on top of himself.

Singed is a Zaunite alchemist of unmatched intellect, who has devoted his life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge—with no price, even his own sanity, too high to pay. Is there a method to his madness? His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.

Zaun's early forays into Hextech were critical to the movement, but not all were met with success. The scientist known as Singed warped his mind and body as he looped noxious, magically-infused chemical byproducts into his veins, twisting himself into a monster.

The doctor Singed induced many dreams with his mastery of science, and in these dreams the queen would gaze across the whole of creation, unraveling its secrets. But the shadow soon found her, and as she so hungered for its power, Singed turned to the craven arts to speed her corruption.

Singed's experiments spit in the face of scientific ethics, each unleashing a new terror onto Zaun. But there is a method to Singed's madness. To make strides in the field of science, one must be willing to do whatever it takes, no matter the cost—and he is happy to pay the price.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Singed was one of the first six champions designed, together with
Annie
,
Lee Sin
,
Sion
,
Sivir
, and
Twisted Fate
.
[2]
[3]
Coincidentally, Singed is an
anagram
for the word design, befitting his history of being one of the earliest designed champions.
Singed was one of the champions chosen for the
Noxian
pool available during the
Ionia vs. Noxus match
. He was one of the selected champions.
Singed's dance references
Will Smith's
"Jump on It"
dance from
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
He shared this dance with
Kayle
before the latter's rework, though hers included the beginning of the dance.
Even though
Poison Trail's
cloud appears to expand as it fades, the area affected by the poison does not actually increase.
Singed is one of the few champions with a special interaction between his
emotes
and his ability set, as
Fling
automatically causes him to laugh.
Although Singed holds his
shield
in his left hand in the default splash art, every other skin shows it in his right hand; Singed holds his shield in his right hand in all the in-game models.
A bottle of Singed's poison can be seen leaking in the Mac Launch preview video.
Singed's bald figure, red and green color motifs, and his large boots make him resemble
Sigma
from the Mega Man/Rockman X series.

Specialist
Specialists
are champions that do not fit into the "neat little boxes" of the other classes, and represent Riot's ideal of having a champion roster with a lot of distinctiveness and diversity.
Examples
Azir
Teemo
Heimerdinger
Singed
Gangplank
League of Legends content
Tank (Legacy)
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Top
Within a
drafted team
, the
Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts
,
Divers
,
Battlemages

Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Howling Abyss
The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
Freljord
. Legends say that, long ago, a great battle took place here on the narrow bridge spanning this chasm. No one remembers who fought here, or why, but it is said that if you listen carefully to the wind you can still hear the cries of the vanquished tossed howling into the Abyss.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
