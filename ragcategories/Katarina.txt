Shunpo
prioritizes damaging enemy champions within range at the targetted location.
After the cast time,
Katarina
will attempt to move towards the closest enemy in
acquisition radius
range and basic attack them, prioritizing champions, unless an attack command was already active on another target in range or any attack command was applied during the cast time. Movement commands applied during cast time will override the automatic attack, but they may not override an already active manually applied attack command. If no enemy is in range, pre-cast commands will remain active, and attack commands applied during the cast time will be ignored

If a
Dagger
is picked during the cast time, pre-cast commands will be cancelled, even if no enemy is nearby. And if an enemy is nearby,
Katarina
may or may not start an automatic attack

Decisive in judgment and lethal in combat, Katarina is a Noxian assassin of the highest caliber. Eldest daughter to the legendary General Du Couteau, she made her talents known with swift kills against unsuspecting enemies. Her fiery ambition has driven her to pursue heavily-guarded targets, even at the risk of endangering her allies—but no matter the mission, Katarina will not hesitate to execute her duty amid a whirlwind of serrated daggers.

Is that a regulation uniform? No. Should a referee be holding a large dagger in the middle of a sports game? No. Are you going to argue with a woman in a non-regulation uniform holding a large dagger in the middle of a sports game? I think we both know the answer to that.

To outsiders, the politics of Bilgewater seem a mean mess of villainous scum and dishonorable thieves. But woven throughout are complex loyalties, solemn codes of honor, and a very specific (if bloody) way of doing things. Cutting through it all is Katarina, a master of the blade. She silences the right tongues at all the right moments… for the right price.

Few other students ever dare approach her.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Katarina's name comes from Greek Αἰκατερίνα/η (Ekaterine).
Du Couteau (her family name) is French for "of the knife".
She shared her namesake with
Caitlyn
and
Kai'Sa
.
She may have been inspired by Katherina from
The Taming of the Shrew
by
William Shakespeare
.
Shunpo
(pronounced: [ɕʉ͍̃mpo] shoom-poh) comes from Sino-Japanese 瞬歩 "blink step".
A framed portrait of Katarina's
second splash art
can be seen in the game's Mac Version trailer.
[2]
Katarina -
Cassiopeia
is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being
Kayle
-
Morgana
,
Garen
-
Lux
,
Nasus
-
Renekton
,
Yasuo
-
Yone
,
Darius
-
Draven
, and
Vi
-
Jinx
).
Though not a pair,
Anivia
,
Ornn
, and
Volibear
are also siblings.
Katarina's dance references
Napoleon Dynamite
, via
one of its portions
.
She used to share this dance with
Master Yi
up until his
rework
, which referenced the other portions.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Voracity's
old
icon was directly edited from her second
Original splash art
.
Katarina is one of few champions to feature two '
Champion Spotlights
' due to significant gameplay changes (the others being
Ezreal
,
Karma
,
Lee Sin
, and
Sivir
).
Katarina is one of the first champions to have one skin for each of the three big annual events of the year:
Lunar Revel
,
Harrowing
,
Snowdown Showdown
. She received her
Warring Kingdoms
skin alongside
Nidalee's
in
Warring Kingdoms 2015
.
The other one is
Jinx
when she received
Ambitious Elf Jinx
in 2017.
Annie
almost became another champion that fulfilled the criteria after
Panda Annie
was released in 2013. However,
Frostfire Annie
was not released during the
Snowdown Showdown
event.
A functional real-life replica of Katarina's
Daggers
was crafted in an episode of YouTube series
Man At Arms: Reforged
.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Takedown
Takedown
refers to a
kill
or
assist
being acceptable, with the type of enemy specified in each use case.
Takedown
is associated with triggering a
passive
effect, or timed effects shortly after scoring.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.

block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.

dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to

Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil
.

block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.

Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.

clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet
that attempts to imitate a
champion
, copying their current vitality, stats, items, level, and most status effects upon creation. They are considered champions against many effects that do not strictly require
player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.
The
damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a
clone

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.

destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

stack
from successful
attack resets

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt
)
Silence
(
Disrupt
