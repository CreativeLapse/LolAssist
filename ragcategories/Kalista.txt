Kalista
shares having an unusual basic attack windup modifier with a few other champions.
See
List of champions/Basic attacks
for a list.
Kalista
also has the longest relative basic attack windup time of all champions, however this is offset by her high base attack speed and attack speed scaling.

Maximum Target Range:
240 / 263 / 280 / 300 (based on Boots Tier)
Dash Speed:
1025 / 1100 / 1160 (based on Boots Tier)
Innate:
During each basic attack or casting of
Pierce
,
Kalista
can optionally choose a target direction to quickly
dash
to. The range is based on dash angle and
Kalista's
Boots
tier. The dash speed scales with
bonus
attack speed
and certain movement speed effects.
Innate - Oathsworn Bond:
Kalista
begins the game with an exclusive
Black Spear
.
Innate:
Whenever
Kalista
inputs a
movement command
during her
basic attack
windup or the cast time of
Pierce
, she will
dash
a short distance in the direction of the inputted location.
Kalista
cannot dash
while
immobilized
or
grounded
, and she will be
knocked down
by any
immobilizing
or
polymorphing
crowd control during the dash.
Martial Poise'
s dash range and speed details:
Dash range of basic attacks is modified by the
tier
of
Kalista's
Boots
and the specific angle of the dash.
At a 0° angle towards the target, the minimum dash range is
140 / 153 / 166 / 175 (based on Boots Tier)
units.
At a 90° angle, the maximum dash range is
240 / 263 / 280 / 300 (based on Boots Tier)
units.
Dash range of
Pierce
is 300 units when dashing anywhere in the direction of the point of cast.
If the dash is inputted to a location that is
away
from
Pierce's
point of cast, the dash range is reduced based on the cast angle, with a minimum distance of 150 units if the inputted location is
directly opposite
to the point of cast.
Dash speed is increased based on the
tier
of
Kalista's
Boots
, and is affected by her
bonus
attack speed
as well as multiplicative
movement speed
modifiers she is under the effect of (including
slows
).
Innate - Oathsworn Bond:
Kalista
begins the game with an exclusive
Black Spear
that she can activate on an allied champion to
force them
to swear an
oath
with her. Once the
oath
has been sworn, the ally becomes her
Oathsworn
, causing
Kalista
to form a
tether
between her and them. While she and the ally bound as the
Oathsworn
are within tether range of each other, they can both interact with
Soul-Mark
and
Fate's Call
.
"The oath has been taken."

Movement commands inputted during an attack windup or the cast time of
Pierce
while
Kalista
is
immobilized
or
grounded
will fail to cast and thus prevent the dash from triggering.
The movement command will still be buffered to the end of the immobilization or the end of the attack windup or cast time of
Pierce
while grounded if it has not been overridden by other inputs.
If multiple movement commands are inputted during the attack windup, the most recent one is used for the dash's targeting.
If the most recent input is not a movement command, the dash will not trigger.
In this case, the buffer for the previous movement command was cancelled by a new non-movement command such as an input for an attack or ability cast.
Dash distance decreases as the dash direction becomes closer to the minimum direction. This defines a forward distance for basic attacks and a backwards distance for
Pierce
.

There is a very brief grace period after completing a basic attack windup wherein
Kalista
can still input a movement command to trigger the dash.
The dash speed is unaffected by additive movement speed modifiers.
There are a total of 24 different dash ranges based on direction with
Boots
and
Pierce
being cast.
Kalista
will automatically be issued an attack command on her attack target at the end of the dash, as long as they remain in her attack range by then.
The attack move (default
A + MB1
) click feature checks for targets in brief intervals only if
Kalista
is not dashing.
Kalista's
facing direction when dashing is considered to be in the direction of the dash, not her apparent facing direction based on her model's animation state.
Sleep
does not count for knocking the dash down.

A specter of wrath and retribution, Kalista is the undying spirit of vengeance, an armored nightmare summoned from the Shadow Isles to hunt deceivers and traitors. The betrayed may cry out in blood to be avenged, but Kalista only answers those willing to pay with their very souls. Those who become the focus of Kalista’s wrath should make their final peace, for any pact sealed with this grim hunter can only end with the cold, piercing fire of her soul-spears.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Scrapper

League of Legends content
Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.

Rend
COOLDOWN:

Passive:
Kalista's
basic attacks and
Pierce
lodge a spear into their target, applying a
stack
of
Rend
for a few seconds.
Active:
Kalista
rips all lodged spears from nearby enemies, consuming all of their stacks to deal
physical damage
and
slow
them for a short time. Each additional spear on the target deals reduced damage.
If
Rend
kills
at least one target, the cooldown is

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage

Pierce
COOLDOWN:

throws a spear in the target direction that deals
physical damage

Rend
stacks to the next enemy it hits.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Arena
Arena
is a team deathmatch game mode organized in a tournament format that consists of eight teams of two players fighting on five different battlefields. Teams brawl in rotating combat rounds while powering themselves up with unique Augments and Items and using multiple environmental features to their advantage, in a display of both deeply tactical and highly explosive combat until the last team standing.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's

Nilah's
Jubilant Veil

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
