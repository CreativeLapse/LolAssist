Any form of vision loss may trigger

Void Assault
grants
Unseen Threat

Kha'Zix
never becomes unseen (e.g. affected by
true sight
).
Other
stealth

Senna's
Curse of the Black Mist
does not do this.
Both the attack's damage and bonus spell damage are grouped under the same Spell ID.
Because of this, a single

Each cast counts as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as

Kha'Zix
receives the evolution even if he dies while in cast time.
Every time
Void Assault
is ranked, a secondary menu will pop up for
Kha'Zix
to select an ability to evolve, this can only be done once per ability.
The only way for
Kha'Zix
to evolve all of his abilities is to gain the fourth evolution point by being victorious in
The Hunt is On!
(by scoring a
takedown
on
Rengar
).

The Void grows, and the Void adapts—in none of its myriad spawn are these truths more apparent than Kha’Zix. Evolution drives the core of this mutating horror, born to survive and to slay the strong. Where it struggles to do so, it grows new, more effective ways to counter and kill its prey. Initially a mindless beast, Kha’Zix’s intelligence has developed as much as its form. Now, the creature plans out its hunts, and even utilizes the visceral terror it engenders in its victims.

Designated K-ZX, the “Mecha Kha'Zix” unit was the first of the mecha line to be deployed against the kaiju threat. Due to its smaller size, it functions best in urban environments, adapting on the fly to threats against civilian populations.

Kha'Zix stalked the waters of Crescent Bay, his teeth and claws greeting anyone foolish enough to wander near. But there was something different about the Empress Ashe: she desired the same, unattainable power he craved. So he swore fealty to her—something he hadn't done in centuries—ready to fight by her side for a taste at the life he once led.

To citizens of Crystalis Motus, the being known as Kha'Zix is a purely crystalline horror whose hunger to assimilate life knows no limits. To those in the north, however, it is a marvel: a being shaped by the crystals themselves into a near perfect form, and whose zeal to spread the Prismae's power is inspirational.

Unseen Threat
(Innate)
When Kha'Zix is not visible to the enemy team, he gains Unseen Threat, causing his next basic attack against an enemy champion to deal bonus magic damage and slow.
Taste Their Fear
(Q)
Deal physical damage to a single target. Damage against isolated targets is significantly increased. Kha'Zix passively marks enemies that are isolated from nearby allies.
Evolved Enlarged Claws:
Increases damage to isolated targets even further. Kha'Zix also gains increased range on both Taste Their Fear and his basic attack.
Void Spike
(W)
Kha'Zix fires spikes that explode on contact, dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies. Kha'Zix is healed if he is within the explosion radius.
Evolved Spike Racks:
Causes Void Spike to fire three projectiles in a cone. Spikes will also apply Unseen Threat to all enemies caught within the area of effect.
Leap
(E)
Kha'Zix leaps to an area, dealing physical damage to enemies in the area he lands.
Evolved Wings:
Increases Leap's range dramatically and causes a kill or assists to refresh the cooldown of Leap.
Void Assault
(Ultimate)
Each rank of Void Assault allows Kha'Zix to evolve one of his active abilities, granting it an additional effect. Upon activation, Kha'Zix enters stealth and gains Unseen Threat, increasing movement speed. Kha'Zix can cast Void Assault again for a short time after activation.
Evolved Active Camouflage:
Allows Kha'Zix to cast Void Assault three times over the course of its duration and reduces any damage he sustains while in stealth.
Trivia

]
Kha'Zix's production name was 'Teek'.
[2]
Ryan 'Morello' Scott
stated Kha'Zix is completely unrelated to canceled champion
Omen
.
[3]
Kha'Zix was the last champion to feature an '
Art Spotlight
'.
When concealing himself (using
Void Assault
) Kha'Zix will run in a different manner than usual.
When acquiring
Evolved Wings
, Kha'Zix will fly for a few seconds while moving (
Pulsefire Ezreal
and
Monarch Kog'Maw
do the same).
The Hunt is On!
between Kha'Zix and
Rengar
references
Alien vs Predator
.
Isolation
references
Alien
(Kha'Zix's main inspiration).
Being an arthropodic invader from another world with scythes as his primary weapon, he also bears a striking resemblance to the real-life
mantis
&
Metroid's Space Pirates
, though he also possesses beetles' hardened outer wings.
Void Spike's
projectiles might be referencing a
Hydralisk's
from
StarCraft
.
Kha'Zix can spend evolution points on abilities he has not learned yet (doing this only benefits
Taste Their Fear
for the bonus range on basic attacks).
Kha'Zix must spend evolution points before ranking up any ability if he has any unspent points after ranking up
Void Assault
.
Kha'Zix is the only Voidborn champion without true damage on any ability (unlike
Feast
,
Icathian Surprise
,
Furious Bite
,
Endless Banquet
,
Organic Deconstruction
, and
Lifeform Disintegration Ray
).
Kha'Zix's name means "You face yourself" in an old mortal language, possibly Shuriman or Ixtalian
Kha'Zix had his game assets reused for several
featured game modes
.
He was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Jumpy Slashy Monster" in
Invasion
.
His animations were reused for the
Shimmerstriker
monster in
Odyssey: Extraction
.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:

Nearsight
A unit that is
nearsighted
has their
sight
radius reduced and
cannot
see beyond their sight radius.
While nearsighted, units cannot reveal
stealthed
wards
or
traps
. Nearsighted units lose vision of all their allies as well as all external sources of vision (including from wards or abilities). This prevents
unit-targeted
effects, including
basic attacks
, from being used outside of the unit's reduced sight radius.
True sight
and
unobstructed vision
do
not
bypass the vision blocked by
nearsight
.
Sources of
nearsight
do
not
stack with each other; only the application with the greatest sight reduction will take effect.
Interrupts:
Interrupts target commands if the
nearsighted
unit's target is outside of their new vision area and prevents
automated target acquisition
.
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
with the exceptions of
Fiora's
Riposte
and
Morgana's
Black Shield
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
with the exceptions of
Yone's
Soul Unbound
(recast),
Cleanse
, and
Mikael's Blessing
.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

True sight
True Sight
reveals units through
fog of war

brush

effects.

Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.
