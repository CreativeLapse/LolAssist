Guerrilla Warfare
Innate:
Teemo
becomes
invisible
after a brief moment remaining idle without taking damage, and will maintain so long as he remains idle or not
displaced
. While
Teemo
is in
brush
, he will gain and maintain stealth even while moving.
Innate - Element of Surprise:
When
Teemo
breaks the stealth, he gains
bonus
attack speed
for a few seconds.
Innate:
Teemo
gains
invisibility
after 1.
5
seconds without moving, taking damage, performing actions that
break stealth
,
channeling
, or being in
stasis
.
Teemo
will maintain stealth so long as he remains idle and is not
displaced
. While in
brush
,
Teemo
gains the stealth even while moving and can move without breaking stealth.
Innate - Element of Surprise:
When
Teemo
breaks the stealth, he gains
20 / 40 / 60 / 80% (based on level)
bonus
attack speed
for 5 seconds.
Info
Targeting input
Passive
If
Teemo
triggers
Element of Surprise
twice in less than 5 seconds he will only refresh the
bonus
attack speed's
duration (it will not
stack
with itself).
Charm
,
Flee
, and
Taunt
will
force
him out of
stealth
.
If
Teemo
is in a
brush
while stealthed, only
Taunt
will break it.
Guerilla Warfare's
stealth is special-cased to be interrupted whenever
Teemo
moves from his location by any means (whether by
dashing
,
blinking
, being
displaced
, or simply moving), thus, performing actions that do not normally
break stealth
which also involve movement will cause the
invisibility
to break. Notably,
Flash
and
Teleport
. If
Teemo
is in a
brush
the aforementioned spells do not end the stealth so long as his exact destination is still inside brush.
Starting
Teleport's
channel will not break
Guerilla Warfare
, only the
blink
upon completing the channel will (with the exception stated above).
Guerilla Warfare
will not activate while
Recalling
.
Using a basic attack breaks the stealth at the end of the attack windup.

The bounce can occur an indefinite amount of times while
Teemo
is alive. If
Teemo
dies before
Noxious Trap
bounces on another, the trap will disappear.

Enemies who step on multiple
Noxious Traps
will only refresh the duration of the damage over time and slow.
Noxious Trap's
damage is determined when it detonates and not when planted, meaning if

changes, the scaling is also altered to affect the active damage of all

Undeterred by even the most dangerous and threatening of obstacles, Teemo scouts the world with boundless enthusiasm and a cheerful spirit. A yordle with an unwavering sense of morality, he takes pride in following the Bandle Scout's Code, sometimes with such eagerness that he is unaware of the broader consequences of his actions. Though some say the existence of the Scouts is questionable, one thing is for certain: Teemo's conviction is nothing to be trifled with.

A side-by-side comparison can be seen

Teemo features in the Season 3 mastery

Teemo,
Akshan
, and
Evelynn
are the only champions who can be permanently stealthed (through
Guerrilla Warfare

Going Rogue
, and
Demon Shade
respectively).
Fiora
draws Teemo's face in the air in her joke emote.
Teemo's blowgun can be seen inside a weapons cabinet in the game's Mac Version trailer.
Teemo being the smallest champion in-game has led to the creation of a measurement unit named after him (used to calculate ranges).
Despite the measurement unit, Teemo's actual size is 110 units in diameter -
"For another point of reference, Teemo has a radius of 55 units and his size is approximately 9,503 units"
.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, the following changes regarding Teemo were jokingly listed:
Cuteness increased by 10%.
Teemo may no longer be the target of hostile attacks or abilities.
Over the years, player frustration from Teemo's abilities and backstory have led to meme and perception that he is an evil individual akin to a demonic figure (specifically
Satan
)
Riot Games
later officially honored this with the release of
Little Devil Teemo
.
Omega Squad Teemo
is voiced by a
new actor
because the previous one no longer works for Riot Games.
Teemo is an
anagram
for the word emote, befitting his recognizable and iconic face which has led to him being an unofficial mascot of sorts.

Specialist
Specialists
are champions that do not fit into the "neat little boxes" of the other classes, and represent Riot's ideal of having a champion roster with a lot of distinctiveness and diversity.
Examples
Azir
Teemo
Heimerdinger
Singed
Gangplank

Marksman (Legacy)
Marksman
(formerly known as 'Carry') excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger.

Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.

Top
Within a
drafted team
, the
Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts
,
Divers
,
Battlemages
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Top Lane
position.
League of Legends content
Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Jungler
position.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Invisibility
Invisibility
is a form of stealth that renders a unit hidden from enemy
vision
for a
short
period of time. It can be utilized to sneak in on opponents as well as the ability to reposition in-combat or simply to flee from a skirmish. It also grants
ghosting
.
Invisible
units can
only
be revealed by
True Sight
.
Stealthed
units shimmer their character model for 0.
6
seconds whenever they take damage.
A unit will shimmer for every instance of damage they take, and shimmering does not make the unit targetable nor remove the
stealth
effect, but grants positional information to the enemy.
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport

Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing
, and
Quicksilver
, remove the
airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Break stealth
Breaking stealth
involves the event of immediately ending the effects of
camouflage
and
invisibility
through actions. By default, all stealth buffs will end prematurely if the user performs a basic attack or casts an ability unless stated otherwise. Summoner spells and item actives vary in whether or not they break stealth.
The following item actives and summoner spells will break stealth upon use:
Black Spear
Hextech Rocketbelt
Profane Hydra
Randuin's Omen
Ravenous Hydra
Redemption
Stridebreaker
Tiamat
Titanic Hydra

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action

Stasis (buff)
A unit that enters
stasis
becomes
invulnerable
and
untargetable
, but also unable to control its movement, declare basic attacks, cast abilities, use summoner spells, or activate items.
Bard's
Tempered Fate

Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Blink
A
blink
refers to a form of movement whereby a unit displaces from point A to B without traversing the space between.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
with the exception of
Mikael's Blessing
.
League of Legends content
Minion
Minions
are autonomous units that spawn periodically from their nexus and advance along the lanes toward the enemy nexus. They
basic attack
any enemy unit or structure they find in their way, but can be killed for
gold
.
There are four kind of
minions
:
melee minions
,
caster minions
,
siege minions
and
super minions
.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Magic damage
Applies:
Corrupting Potion
Morellonomicon's

.
Mystic Shot
applies
on-hit
and

League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends
. Each champion possesses unique abilities and
attributes
.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
