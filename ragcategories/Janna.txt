Armed with the power of Runeterra’s gales, Janna is a mysterious, elemental wind spirit who protects the dispossessed of Zaun. Some believe she was brought into existence by the pleas of Runeterra’s sailors who prayed for fair winds as they navigated treacherous waters and braved rough tempests. Her favor and protection has since been called into the depths of Zaun, where Janna has become a beacon of hope to those in need. No one knows where or when she will appear, but more often than not, she’s come to help.

Practitioners of Hextech science have historically benefited from the core crystalline matrix's more esoteric properties. Janna's long exposure to such raw materials famously granted her the power of limited flight, and the ability to control the wind.

Hailing from Aurai, floating high above the Tournament, Queen Janna quite literally looks down on the whole affair. But without a champion in the Coronation, the magic that brings long-life to Aurai's reclusive population will fail, and so Janna descends for yet another showcase exhibition of her power. Anything to protect her people.

The desire for peace brought about more than just a yearly festival. Born from this universal wish was Janna, a spirit whose magic hangs like a wreath over the night. Though she's regarded by most as a legend, guests sometimes say they see a beautiful woman float by. Maybe it's a trick of the crystal rose's light...

An experiment from RSM's R&D division, Janna is the only successful use of an android to pilot an exosuit in history. Perhaps it's because she looks so human that most forget the gusts of “wind“ she commands are actually a fleet of nanobots connected directly to both the X09-Zephyr as well as her central processing core.

Janna is the most skilled dragon in the kingdom at sorcery (save for the king himself, perhaps), whipping up winds and steering the clouds. The prince asked if she might take him on as a pupil, and Janna happily accepted; but she is looking forward to showing him more whimsical uses of their power. After all, they have a festival to attend.

Janna is
voiced
by
Erin Fitzgerald
.
[2]
Sona
,
DJ Sona
and
PsyOps Sona
are also voiced by the same voice actress.
During development she was called
AirAvatar
, which then turned into her title 'The Avatar of Air' before getting changed to 'The Storm's Fury'.
Some localizations retain it (French:
L'avatar De L'air
).
Janna's original lore might have been inspired by
Storm
from
X-Men
.
She herself might have been based on
Barbariccia
from
Final Fantasy IV
.
Janna is the only champion able to shield turrets (
Eye of the Storm
).
Turrets can help her score
kills
indirectly by doing this.

Enchanter
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Enchanters
focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.
Examples
Janna
Sona
Soraka

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,

.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing

airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter

Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap

shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

League of Legends content
Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's

Targeting forgiveness
Certain unit-targeted abilities present an accuracy-grace system called
targeting forgiveness
.
When no valid target is
directly selected
upon using the ability, it will automatically search for one within a certain
center-to-center
forgiveness radius
. If a valid target is found within the forgiveness radius, the ability will automatically acquire them and cast on them. If multiple targets are found, the nearest one to the forgiveness radius' center is chosen.
Only ally-targeted abilities may utilize this system. Not to be confused with a different, priority-based system that a few other spells (e.g.
Smite
) use.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.

A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.

A
movement channel
