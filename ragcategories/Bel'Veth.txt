bonus
attack speed

basic attacks
each consume 1 stack.
Innate:
Whenever
Bel'Veth
scores a
takedown
against a
champion
,
monster
, or large
minion
within 3 seconds of damaging them, she generates a permanent stack of
Lavender

COOLDOWN:
1
CAST TIME:
1
RANGE:
350
EFFECT RADIUS:
500
Passive:
Every second basic attack on the same target deals
bonus
true damage
and generates a stack that increases the damage. This can stack infinitely, and expires after a short time or upon switching targets.
Passive:
Takedowns
against enemy
champions
and epic
monsters
spawn a
Void Coral
for some time. Taking down
Baron Nashor
, the pit
Rift Herald
, or a
Voidgrub

Enhance Void Coral
.
Active:
Bel'Veth
dashes
to the target
Void Coral
, gradually
slowing
nearby enemies before violently exploding, dealing
true damage
based on

can
dash
through terrain, consuming more
Void Corals
renews the form's duration and
heals her
instead.
Enhanced Void Coral Bonus:
True Form
is empowered with a longer duration and causes
Void Remora
to spawn from minions that die nearby.
Passive:
Bel'Veth's
basic attacks
on-hit
apply a mark to the target for 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits. Every second attack
on-hit
against the marked target deals
bonus
true damage
and generates a stack of
Endless Banquet
that increases this damage by the same value. This effect stacks infinitely, but is capped at 5 stacks against epic
monsters
. The mark and stacks expire upon attacking a new target.
Bonus True Damage:

monster
while alive, a
Void Coral
is spawned from their corpse for 15 seconds.
Baron Nashor
, the pit
Rift Herald
, and
Voidgrubs
(once per spawn group) spawn an
Enhanced Void Coral
.
Active:
Bel'Veth
dashes
to the target
Void Coral
to consume it over the cast time,
slowing
nearby enemies by
25% − 96% (based on seconds elapsed)
for the duration. She then creates an explosion at the location to deal
true damage
to enemies within, capped at
1500
versus monsters, and assumes her
True Form
for 60 seconds.
Bel'Veth
consumes all existing
Void Corals
at once, generating a stack of
Lavender
for each one consumed.

True Form's

consumes.
Consuming a normal
Void Coral
in a normal
True Form
state refreshes the duration to 60 seconds.
Consuming an enhanced
Void Coral
refreshes the duration to 180 seconds and grants the enhanced effects regardless of current
True Form
state.
If she consumes a normal
Void Coral
while in an enhanced
True Form
state, the current duration is extended by 60 seconds.
The enhanced effects are
not
lost in this case.
Bel'Veth
will consume all existing
Void Corals
at once, therefore she is able to acquire the enhanced effects of
True Form
even if she does not physically consume an enhanced
Void Coral
.
The
Void Coral

Bel'Veth

She dashes at the start of the cast time.
A

A nightmarish empress created from the raw material of an entire devoured city, Bel’Veth is the end of Runeterra itself... and the beginning of a monstrous reality of her own design. Driven by epochs of repurposed history, knowledge, and memories from the world above, she voraciously feeds an ever-expanding need for new experiences and emotions, consuming all that crosses her path. Yet her wants could never be sated by only one world as she turns her hungry eyes toward the Void’s old masters...

True final boss of the hit 1998 RPG "Initial Reverie VIII," Bel'Veth has become a staple of the series thanks to fan popularity and her storyline about assimilating all of reality into herself. Recruited into the war in Arcadia by Veigar, she has decided to ignore his commands, annihilate everything in her path, and assimilate all of Arcade World into herself. Who could have seen it coming?

A lonely cradle of life amongst the stars, Bel'Veth wanders ruined space in the aftermath of the Cosmic Court's destruction. She refuses to allow the Dark Star's entropy to spread any further, and so has begun plucking chosen creatures from dying worlds, imbuing them with the power to fight by her side and contain the corruption before it is too late.

The tide of war has turned, with Primordians scattered and Anima Squad idling safely in Final City. But deep below the tranquil sea, Bel'Veth plots. A creature of incredible intelligence, she grew used to living in Aatrox's shadow, her masterful tactics less bombastic than his brute strength. Now her time has come to rise above the waters and strike.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Bel'Veth
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bard
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Nasus
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
,
Thresh
, and
Veigar
.
In Bel'Veth's case,
Death in Lavender
infinitely stacks the bonus attack speed gained from
Lavender
stacks and
Endless Banquet
infinitely stacks the bonus true damage dealt by the passive.
If
Bel'Veth
has an attack speed of
1.
8
or higher, her attack animations will change to thrust at the target instead of swiping at them.

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.

Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.

Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are

.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage

;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks

critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends

Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets
.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most

abilities.
It is
less

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity

Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity

Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Applies life steal
"Applies life steal"
is a
damage tag
that gives an ability the property of having a damage source apply
life steal
like
basic attack damage
would.
This tag is located on some abilities that deal
spell damage
(e.g.
Samira's
Flair
and
Inferno Trigger
) and
items
that deal damage
on-hit
.
Life steal
does not have a penalty for
area of effect
abilities and is always applied to the damage dealt at 100% effectiveness, unless otherwise specified. Unlike
Vamp
, the
"applies life steal"
tag applies life steal directly and does not
heal
based on damage dealt and the life steal
stat
. Therefore healing modifiers that affect
life steal
also affect abilities with the
"applies life steal"
tag.

On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
