heal
herself while she is wounded.

Unburrow
will not knock up the nearest target if they're a minion or small monster.
(bug)
Minions or small monsters are only knocked up only in the case of
Rek'Sai
casting
Unburrow
by declaring an attack command against them.
Rek'Sai's
attack range is reduced by 50 while
Burrowed
, which makes an automatic cast of
Unburrow
always put Rek'Sai at least 50 units within her attack range against the target to follow up with.
Note that the
Unborrow
effect radius is usually greater than
75, meaning Rek'Sai can knock up a single target from slightly further away when she casts
Unburrow
the standard way, but may have to walk slightly closer to attack that target afterwards.
Unburrow
does not count as an ability activation for the purposes of on-cast effects such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive.
Unburrow
is still considered an ability and is thus stopped by
silence
. She can basic attack normally during this time, without leaving
unburrow
.
For a brief moment during the beginning animation of
Tunnel

Rek'Sai
can trigger
Unburrow

Tunnel

Rek'Sai
targets either entrance, shutting down the
Tunnel

Rek'Sai

Tunnel

Tunnel
entrances are
visible
on allied champions' minimaps, while enemies must first gain
sight
of one before it becomes visible on theirs (the opposite entrance is not revealed).
Destroying a
Tunnel
while
Rek'Sai
is traversing it will not prevent her from reaching the opposite entrance.
Rek'Sai
can
Tunnel
through terrain if she dashes close to them and the wall is thin enough to allow the opposite entrance to spawn on the other side.
If
Rek'Sai
issues an attack command while the dash passes by an enemy, the target will be knocked up but
Rek'Sai
will still complete the movement.
Tips & Tricks
Enemies can block
Rek'Sai
from using a tunnel entrance if a
ward
is placed directly over it, because the cursor's target selection prioritizes wards over tunnel entrances.
Rek'Sai
will take longer to enter a
Tunnel
from
Un-Burrowed
state because she needs to become
Burrowed

An apex predator, Rek’Sai is a merciless Void-spawn that tunnels beneath the ground to ambush and devour unsuspecting prey. Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great empire of Shurima—merchants, traders, even armed caravans, will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid her and her offspring’s hunting grounds. All know that once Rek’Sai is seen on the horizon, death from below is all but guaranteed.

When the Ice Witch looked to the great glaciers of True Ice towering over the far north, she saw an army in the making. Among the first to be sculpted was Rek'Sai, a vessel of chilling savagery befitting a queen's power. Now, granted sentience by the will of the Watchers, she terrorizes domains with the brutal instincts of an apex predator.

Final City built its barricades high, protecting its citizens from countless Primordian threats. Rek'Sai laughs in the face of these obstructions—or at least mimics a laugh in the form of a loud, painful screech. Having evolved to tunnel beneath land, she is the ideal infiltrator, the first Primordian to lay eyes on Final City… but certainly not the last.

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
Rek'Sai is the first female
Voidborn
released.
Rek'Sai is the first
fighter
champion released without a secondary role.
Rek'Sai's design was greatly influenced
[2]
by the canceled champion
Omen
.
Just like with
Cho'Gath
,
Malphite
,
Nautilus
, and
Skarner
, Rek'Sai's in-game size is smaller than
in-universe
(she is
estimated
to be as large as a 'small
T. rex
,
mammoth
,
whale shark
, large but not huge').
Rek'Sai had her game assets reused for several
featured game modes
.
She was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Grumpy Burrow Monster" (along with its huge variant) in
Invasion
.
Her animations were reused for the
Anchortail
,
Brightcore
, and
Rhinodon
monsters in
Odyssey: Extraction

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Fury
Fury
is an umbrella term for many named resources that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
or
Energy
that exist in some quantity beforehand. For most users, this resource is only required by a single ability or passive effect.
It represents
momentum
and encourages sustained aggression from users, often gating a power-spike or empowerment.
Fury
generation varies between users, but is always generated
in-combat
(e.g. on-hit, ability casts or taking damage) and often decays when out of combat.

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil
.
League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind

dodge

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The
duration

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Ghosted
A unit that is
ghosted
ignores
unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.
League of Legends content
Obscured vision
An
obscured
target only has their position revealed to the enemy—such as through a silhouette or movement pattern as a visual effect—but their unit remains an un-rendered target for selection (i.e. they cannot be selected for
unit-targeted
attacks, draw
monster
aggro). The revealed silhouettes' color is different among
champions
, wards, and all other non-champion units (default:
red
,
blue
, and
purple
; respectively).
This is distinct from being
untargetable
, as an
obscured unit
is still vulnerable to
auras
,
direction-targeted
and
ground-targeted
effects, and
auto-targeted
effects that do not require
sight
of targets.
Obscured vision
is not concealed by
nearsight
.

Force Pulse
COOLDOWN:
21 / 20 / 19 / 18 / 17
Passive:
Ability casts reduce the cooldown of this ability.

slows
them.
League of Legends content
Unburrow
STATIC CD:
1
Active:
Rek'Sai
becomes
Un-Burrowed
, gaining access to her
Un-Burrowed
abilities. Additionally, she deals
magic damage
to nearby enemies and
knocks them aside
. The nearest enemy hit is instead
knocked up
, and cannot be affected again by
Unburrow
for some time.
Rek'Sai
can automatically cast
Unburrow
by basic attacking an enemy, applying the
knock up
against the target.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
