Icathian Surprise
EFFECT RADIUS:
400
Innate:
Upon
dying
,
Kog'Maw
enters an
untargetable
zombie state
for a few seconds, gradually gaining
bonus
movement speed
. He explodes at the end of the duration, dealing
true damage
to nearby enemies.
Innate:
Upon taking
fatal damage
,
Kog'Maw
enters a
zombie state
for 4 seconds, becoming
ghosted
and gaining
10%
bonus
movement speed
that increases up to
50%
over the duration. At the end of the duration, he explodes to deal
140 − 650 (based on level)
true damage
to nearby enemies.
While under this state,
Kog'Maw
becomes
invulnerable
,
untargetable
, and
immune to crowd control
, but is also rendered unable to declare
basic attacks
, cast
abilities
, use
summoner spells

Icathian Surprise

is killed by the

.
If
Kog'Maw
has the missile from a basic attack in-flight at the same time that he's moving while he dies, as long as the missile hits the target after

Kog'Maw
will be able to use a basic attack once during
Icathian Surprise

will be placed on a 5 second cooldown upon becoming a zombie.
During

Kog'Maw's

Raw damage

All

A champion that enters a zombie state will start their death timer upon triggering the effect.
Most buffs and debuffs will be lost upon transitioning into a zombie state.
Those that persist through death, such as
Brand's
Blaze
, will remain.
Undisplayed marker buffs, such as those imposed by
Veigar's
Event Horizon
and
Viktor's
Gravity Field
to prevent being affected multiple times by the same effect, will be lost.

Belched forth from a rotting Void incursion deep in the wastelands of Icathia, Kog’Maw is an inquisitive yet putrid creature with a caustic, gaping mouth. This particular Void-spawn needs to gnaw and drool on anything within reach to truly understand it. Though not inherently evil, Kog’Maw’s beguiling naiveté is dangerous, as it often precedes a feeding frenzy—not for sustenance, but to satisfy its unending curiosity.

Kog'Maw, ever lost in thought, sat upon his toadstool until he was famished. “Wonderland is full of such delights,” he mused, gulping down the toadstool entirely. “It would be a shame not to devour them all.”

But taming one is an even more challenging task. Only one Tamer has succeeded so far, their bond—and the Zap'Maw's lightning attacks—growing stronger each day.

In defiance of the maelstrom's power, the beast Kog'Maw safely rides along its currents thanks to its nigh-unbreakable shell. Perpetually at odds with itself, its tail is addicted to feeding on the maelstrom's energy, while its head simply wants to devour everything in sight. Can anything within the Scrolls sate its growing hunger?

Trivia

]
Kog'Maw is
voiced
by
Patrick Seitz
.
Renekton
is also voiced by the same voice actor, while
Lucian
used to be voiced by the same voice actor.
Kog'Maw's dance references
Michigan J. Frog's
dance
from
One Froggy Evening
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Despite
Icathian Surprise
causing him to blow up, Kog'Maw does have a 'normal' death animation which can only be seen when he's being revived by
Chronoshift
or
Guardian Angel
.
Icathian Surprise
is one of only three abilities that allow their casters to
continue fighting after death
, the others being
Death Defied
and
Glory in Death
.
Kog'Maw is the only Void-related champion without 'Void' in his title.
While idle Kog'Maw blinks one eye at a time and sometimes spins around in a manner resembling dogs chasing their own tail.
Kog'Maw was the first champion to have a joke animation (the second being
Miss Fortune
).
Kog'Maw was first spotted in a screenshot from
Malzahar's
reveal.
Maw is another word for mouth.
Kog'Maw's abilities ironically make no use of his spoken-of and downright-self-stated insatiable hunger.
Kog'Maw had his game assets reused for several
featured game modes
.
He was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Scary Spitty Monster" in
Invasion
.
His animations were reused for the
Arcraptor
and
Skitterbeak
monsters in
Odyssey: Extraction
.
His model were reused as mini-boss in
Swarm
.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called
"Seeing-Eye Kog"
, referencing a seeing-eye dog, another term for
Guide dog
.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP

abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

abilities

Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's

Ranged
champions have a basic attack

projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion
after
Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
. It prevents enemies from gaining full kill credit or triggering most on-kill effects from the champion a second time, and some abilities (e.g.
You and Me!
) interact differently with champions in this state.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
and
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects.
The following effects trigger a champion to enter a
zombie state
:
Karthus'
Death Defied
Kog'Maw's
Icathian Surprise
Sion's
Glory in Death
League of Legends content
Ghosted
A unit that is
ghosted
ignores
unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.
League of Legends content
Invulnerability
A unit that is
Invulnerable
reduces all damage taken to
0
and prevents effects that trigger from damage.
League of Legends content
Cc-Immune
Crowd control immunity
prevents
any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic
monsters
(excluding a summoned
Rift Herald
) and
turrets
are always immune to all crowd control, with the exception of
stasis
.
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall
or
Blade Whirl
(usually vanishing without any effect).
The following abilities perform one or more
projectile popping events
:
Most
abilities and effects that grant
untargetability
pop projectiles when the unit gains the status effect.
Master Yi's
Alpha Strike
in particular pops targeted projectiles on each game tick for its duration.
Gwen's
Hallowed Mist
pops all projectiles (from enemy champions outside of its area of effect) targeted at her that attempt to pass through or be inside its area of effect.

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's
Unbreakable
,
Samira's
Blade Whirl
, and
Yasuo's
Wind Wall
can block, destroy and / or stop projectiles.
Some
ranged
basic attacks (
including
turrets
) and abilities don't use projectiles and will bypass projectile-blocking effects.
Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.

Nexus Obelisk
The
Nexus Obelisk
, (or
Fountain Laser
), is a turret that deals tons of damage, bypassing survival tools such as
invulnerability
and
resurrection
. A
Nexus Obelisk
presides over each team's spawn platform on most maps.
League of Legends content
Raw damage
Raw damage
is a type of damage that normally ignores resistances,
shields
, and
minimum health threshold
and
resurrection
effects on the target.
Invulnerability
and
spell shields
,  where applicable, are the only ways to reduce or negate
raw damage
. Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against an enemy always deal more than
100% of the target's
current
health
(
"execution damage"
). Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against the player's own champion or an ally are special-cased to take place during effects that protect champions from death. Current implementations of
minimum health thresholds
are special-cased to leave units at
1 health
rather than the threshold, when they are dealt lethal
raw damage
.
Raw damage
does not interact with
any
effect.
Internal raw
damage is a form of
raw damage
that also bypasses
invulnerability
and has no overrides in place to prevent it from killing death-protected champions. The
Nexus Obelisk
,
Zac's
Cell Division
redirected damage, and
Rift Herald's
self-damage also have this modified form.
League of Legends content
Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects. Entering
resurrection
does not cancel cast times.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.

Blaze
Innate:
Brand's

mana
.
At three stacks,
champions
