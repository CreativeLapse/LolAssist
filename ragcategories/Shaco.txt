Abilities
Clone
For enemies,
Hallucination
is supposed to be visually identical to
Shaco
. For himself and allies, the clone remains visually distinct.
Mimic
Hallucination
can mimic the casting of
Deceive
,
Jack in the Box
and
Two-Shiv Poison
:
When the clone
blinks
by any means, such as if it exits
Shaco's
leash range, it will play
Deceive's
entering stealth "cloud" VFX (without actually gaining its effects, of course).
If the clone is within 300 units of
Shaco
when he casts
Jack in the Box
, it will play the ability's cast animation of placing the box.
If the clone is within 575 units of
Shaco's
target for
Two-Shiv Poison
when the ability is cast, it will play the ability's cast animation of throwing the dagger in addition to firing a fake missile at the target. This missile has no effect on the target when it arrives.
Seeing Double
Hallucination
benefits from
Shaco's
items
but not from his
runes
. It propagates its own
auras
, but the effects will not stack between
Shaco
and
Hallucination
.
Shaco's
buffs
will be visually copied on the clone's status bar. Lastly, if
Shaco's
model is affected by a visual buff or debuff when
Hallucination
is created, then the clone will also also copy that visual aspect.
Surprise!
Hallucination
explodes upon expiring or dying, dealing magic damage to all enemies around it and dropping three
mini-boxes
around itself which activate instantly, causing nearby enemies to
flee
from them, as well as attacking nearby enemies before expiring or upon being destroyed. Targets are also briefly
rooted
.
Notes

]
Most
named item effects
work as expected for the clone, e.g.
Annul
's
spell shield
or
Lifeline
's health
shield
. A reminder that
Hallucinate's
basic attacks apply as
pet damage
, a damage type that does not interact with most effects, while the explosion applies as
area damage
which interacts with most
spell effects
such as
Luden's Companion's
Fire
or
Malignance's
Hatefog
.
Cho'Gath's

considers
Hallucination
as a champion for its stacking purposes.

Crafted long ago as a plaything for a lonely prince, the enchanted marionette Shaco now delights in murder and mayhem. Corrupted by dark magic and the loss of his beloved charge, the once-kind puppet finds pleasure only in the misery of the poor souls he torments. He uses toys and simple tricks to deadly effect, finding the results of his bloody 'games' hilarious—and for those who hear a dark chuckle in the dead of night, the Demon Jester may have marked them as his next plaything.

Shaco was once a region of space known for raucous celebration, wiped clean by the Dark Star and reborn into the mocking visage of a jester. His twisted cackling reaches inhabited systems long before he does, provoking visions of destruction, and societal breakdowns that will soon feed his endless hunger.

Once a mere courier for the Twitch syndicate, Shaco is now barely human. The eldritch corruption has stripped him of reason and identity, turning him into a chittering horde of knife-wielding monsters that haunt the boroughs of Valoran City. None of them are sure which is the “real” Shaco anymore. None of them care.

The Automaton Shaco felt nothing toward the quarreling leaders until Polaris snapped her fingers and ordered her “gifts” to corner the trio. “Winter is cruel,” she boomed, “and warmth is meant to be shared. Let this punishment serve as a warning.” In a flurry of snow, Polaris disappeared, leaving the Automaton and Beast to dispense her judgment.

I know very little about this fighter... and I've been told by our host to say EVEN LESS! (They've GOT to be friends... or mortal enemies?) His desires are hidden—just like his face—and his style in the ring remains to be seen! We just LOVE a mysterious and not-at-all creepy combatant, don't we, folks? Here he is... Shaaaaaaaacoooooo!

Shaco is never predictable; his unique (and often terrifying) looks make him a hit with judges year after year. Now adorned in gold and ivory lace, Shaco claims to be making a statement about fast fashion and the constraints it puts on designers and models. Or maybe he just wants an excuse to show off his soul-power arms.

Cast beneath the floorboards with contraband and mold, confined within a simple toy, Shaco plotted worldwide doom. All he needed was a fool to spring him from his bindings and perform the ritual rites, but he should have known—never trust a Creepaway camper to get a ritual right!

Trivia
[

ERROR:
Shaco's eyes are mistakenly colored purple on his uncentered splash art, Loading screen, Square, and Circle assets. They are supposed to be blue, as shown in his model, newest emotes, Illustration and Champie icons, centered splash art, and old splash art.
Shaco is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses
Hallucinate
, his clone will be of a different colour palette which can only be seen by Shaco and his allies. To the opposing team, the two Shacos look exactly the same, including copies of any external
buffs
and
item
effects active at the moment the clone is spawned (Prior to patch
V5.22
, clones did not duplicate external buff/active item effect particles).
Four other champions with this feature are
LeBlanc
(via
Mirror Image
),
Wukong's
(via
Warrior Trickster
),
Nasus
(via
Fury of the Sands
) and
Malphite
(via
Granite Shield
and
Thunderclap
).
Shaco's dance references
The Worm
, a
breakdance move
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
Shaco
might be referencing the
Harlequin
Crest
from
Diablo
.
It's possible that many aspects of Shaco's champion design, such as his appearance, his laugh and his "manic killer clown" persona were inspired by
Kefka Palazzo
from
Final Fantasy VI
.
The name
Shaco
is an
anagram
for the word 'chaos' (mentioned in the
Journal of Justice
- Issue 13: 10 Questions with Shaco), befitting his penchant for it.
There was a rework concept that turned Shaco into a
projectile
but hitting a
Wind Wall
in this form would remove him from the game.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers

Vanguards

Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage

A unit that is
rooted
is unable to control its movement or activate movement spells for the duration. This effect does not innately
knockdown
a target that is already performing a dash.
Rooted
units can still be displaced.
Root
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Moving
includes movement commands.
Movement spells
include all
dash
and
blink
abilities - including
Recall
/
Empowered Recall
and the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Dash
, plus a number of additional cases.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
movement channels
unless otherwise stated
.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Invulnerability
A unit that is
Invulnerable
reduces all damage taken to
0
and prevents effects that trigger from damage.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.

Howling Abyss
The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
Freljord
. Legends say that, long ago, a great battle took place here on the narrow bridge spanning this chasm. No one remembers who fought here, or why, but it is said that if you listen carefully to the wind you can still hear the cries of the vanquished tossed howling into the Abyss.
