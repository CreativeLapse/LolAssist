Innate:
Zed's
basic attacks against targets

The enhanced attack applies other
on-hit effects
and can
critically strike
as normal (the bonus damage cannot).
Contempt for the Weak
is not consumed when
dodged

missed
, but it is consumed when
blocked

Contempt for the Weak
considers the target's health upon landing the attack, not when it's declared.
If the target falls below the threshold while
Zed
is winding up the attack,
Contempt for the Weak
applies, and vice versa.
The empowered attack will not trigger against

gains a buff for 7.
5
seconds that indicates and determines the duration in which he may recast
Death Mark
.
The buff is granted on-cast and lingers for 0.
25
seconds after it expires.
The
Shadow
is spawned the moment
Death Mark
is cast.
Zed
will track the target if they change locations.
He will dash through the target's previous location while still applying the
mark
if they are 2200 or more units away.
Zed
will be ordered to basic attack his target after reappearing.
Death Mark's
stored damage derives from all
basic attacks
,
abilities
,
items
,
runes
and
buffs
.
Death Mark's
Shadow
is functionally the same as a regular one, but it lasts longer and can be swapped to regardless of range.
The range at which it mimics
Zed's
abilities does not change.
The
mark
can be prevented by becoming
untargetable
before it is applied (untargetability after application will not prevent the mark's detonation).
Spell shields
will only block the
mark's
application. They will not prevent
Zed
from initiating the cast nor block the detonation from a
mark
that is already applied.
If
Zed
dies during
Death Mark
, the ability will cancel instantly and he will reappear at his current location. The cooldown is not compensated.
If he enters
resurrection
before the dash,
Death Mark
does not cancel. If he enters it while dashing, the dash is interrupted.
If the
dash
is interrupted,
Zed
stops, places himself to the ground (ends all displacements affecting him, but does not remove
airborne
effects), and reappears prematurely at his current location. The
mark
will still be applied regardless.
Zed
will remove
airborne
effects from himself immediately upon starting the dash.
Once
Zed
begins the
dash
, two
Shadows
will also appear to be dashing through his target, each one spawning a certain distance behind the target (from the right and left). These
shadows
do
not
mimic abilities and disappear immediately after they stop dashing but they grant
sight
of their surroundings.
These
shadows
have a tracking distance of 2200 and a dash speed of 1750.
Death Mark
does not cancel if the target enters a
zombie state
before the dash begins.
If the
mark's
post-mitigation damage
is higher than the target's
current
health, a
spinning shuriken
will appear above the victim. This does not necessarily mean the target will die, as it does not consider
shields
or forms of
damage modifiers
that are not respected by this predictive calculation.

Utterly ruthless and without mercy, Zed is the leader of the Order of Shadow, an organization he created with the intent of militarizing Ionia’s magical and martial traditions to drive out Noxian invaders. During the war, desperation led him to unlock the secret shadow form—a malevolent spirit magic as dangerous and corrupting as it is powerful. Zed has mastered all of these forbidden techniques to destroy anything he sees as a threat to his nation, or his new order.

An elite operative of the Shockblade order, Zed dives into battle with lightning-fast lethality. Though his former partner Shen hasn't forgiven himself for nearly getting Zed killed, Zed still urges him to return to the front lines; and yet the Storm rages on, whether or not the duo are reunited. Zed will bring its fury to bear alone if he must.

As loyalty fractures within the Blood Moon cult, Zed remains Twisted Fate's unshakable right hand and personal power broker. He trades in secrets, shadows, and blood, all while using his mastery over his demon to increase the cult's influence. What Twisted Fate doesn't know is that Zed is also searching for his lost acolyte, stolen by the Snow Moon.

Zed
is one of 21 champions without a single

Urgot
,
Xayah
, and
Yone
.
Zed's dance was inspired
[2]
by various martial arts (the animator is a
black belt
).
Zed is the first champion to not actually 'die' in his death animation, instead he drops into a
shadow portal
(Shockblade Zed disappears after struck by a
lightning bolt)
. The second is
Ekko
, who rewinds time.
Willump
does die, but
Nunu
does not.
Zed,
Sona
,
Garen
and
Vi
were targeted by
Jhin
in his teaser.
After Zed was
shot
, his champion icon on his
League of Legends
page
and the
champion list
was updated to a
gif
with petals blowing past him.
Zed is the fifth champion to use energy as a resource for abilities (the others being
Akali
,
Kennen
,
Lee Sin
and
Shen
).
Before the release of
Galaxy Slayer Zed
and
Pulsefire Shen
, neither him nor
Shen
reveal their faces in any of their skins, unlike
Akali
(
All-star
,
Nurse
,
Blood Moon
) and
Kennen
(
Karate
,
M.D.
).
Zed and
Lucian
perform the
'airplane arms'
run when having very high movement speed.
Razor Shuriken
,
Living Shadow
, and
Shadow Slash
respectively mirroring
Thundering Shuriken
,
Shadow Dash
, and
Crescent Slash
, as well as
Death Mark
,
Assassin's Mark
, and
Mark of the Storm
marking their targets reference Zed having been a Kinkou Order member.
Death Mark
was
conceived
with spawning two
Living Shadows
and was animated accordingly on release.
Clicking one of the
Living Shadows
during
Death Marks
animation used to display
Akali's
portrait. This could only be done while spectating in slow motion as his shadows in an actual game were just simply too fast to be clicked on. It was removed after the new HUD came in 2015 and replaced the old one.
Zed and his enemy counterpart could theoretically increase their AD infinitely with
Reaper of Shadows
by alternating killing each other, before it was removed from the game in
V9.4
.
Zed used to gain the
'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength'
cosmetic
Easter egg
debuff (
"This unit is a flippin' ninja!"
-
"Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health."
) when he,
Akali
,
Kennen
, and/or
Shen
found themselves on the same team. It was removed in
V3.14
for unknown reasons.
At 23 August 2018 players who selected "Assassin" as their favorite class rated Zed 27% higher than the other assassins as "One of my favorite champions". This difference is the largest for a champion by class.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Middle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Mid Laner
is the champion assigned to the mid lane.
Burst Mages
,
Artillery Mages
, and
Assassins
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Mid Laner
position.
League of Legends content
Jungle
Within a
drafted team

Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.

Energy
Energy
is a resource designed to limit how much a champion is able to use their
basic
abilities during a set time frame rather than through the use of
mana
. It is represented by a
yellow
bar instead of
blue
.
Energy
has a maximum of
200
(except for
Shen
, with
400
), and regenerates rapidly, at a rate of
10 energy
per second. This means that energy champions are not at risk of depleting their resource over a long period of time, however the small capacity restricts the rapid usage of multiple spells.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.

The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends
. Each champion possesses unique abilities and
attributes
.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil
.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses
with the exception of
Mikael's Blessing
.
League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind
and
dodge
take precedence over
block
.
Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet
,
Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.

movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
