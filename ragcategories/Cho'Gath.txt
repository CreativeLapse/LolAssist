The missiles are launched from an offset 25 units in front of Cho'Gath and towards the target's location on-attack-complete.
When attacking enemies within 25 units center-to-center of
Cho'Gath
, the missile will fire in the opposite direction.
Cho'Gath's
size factors into the wideness of the hitbox
Vorpal Spikes
has. External size modifiers (
Wild Growth
) contribute to this.
At certain size thresholds, the missile gets replaced by a different one with a different width. At each step, the width grows by 30, except for the 3rd missile, where it only grows by 10.
(note)
Some of the size thresholds are placed very weird.
(note)
The missile range is unchanged.
The empowered attack will trigger but not apply its effects against

From the moment Cho’Gath first emerged into the harsh light of Runeterra’s sun, the beast was driven by the most pure and insatiable hunger. A perfect expression of the Void’s desire to consume all life, Cho’Gath’s complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growth—increasing its muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic diamond. When growing larger does not suit the Void-spawn’s needs, it vomits out the excess material as razor-sharp spines, leaving prey skewered and ready to feast upon later.

Prior to indulging in the delectable taste of his victims, Cho'Gath prefers to invite them to his humble 40-acre mansion. There, he offers scones and jam, with a spot of tea… so his guests may savor their last meal before becoming one themselves.

Citing nothing more than a blurry photograph, the locals in one isolated town insist on the existence of a large, predatory marine animal that grows in size every time it feeds. The reports are otherwise unsubstantiated, but the spike in tourism has been great for the local economy. Not the disappearances, though. Those are bad.

A living weapon of Nocturne's design, Cho'Gath is meant to cleanse the world of the Neverghaast. Empowered by sacred artifacts from the congregation's crypts, it has remained dormant while Nocturne feeds it prisoners to build its power. Despite its maker's intentions, nothing will be able to sate the monster's hunger once it fully awakens.

]
Cho'Gath
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bard
,
Bel'Veth
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Nasus
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
,
Thresh
, and
Veigar
.
In Cho'Gath's case,
Feast
infinitely stacks his
health
.
Cho'Gath was the first
champion
to receive a second
Legendary
skin
(though
Corki
has two
1820
skins both of which are
Legacy
and
Tristana
has also two
1820
skins although one is Legacy and the other one is available).
Cho'Gath's dance references
Fantasmic!
by
Mickey Mouse
.
Riot
created an
Adobe Flash
minigame dedicated for him called
Cho'Gath Eats the World
for
April Fools' Day
2013
.
Another minigame released on the same date,
Astro Teemo
, which was unlocked by playing to a certain point in this game.
The depiction of Cho'Gath in the
icon of
Feral Scream
was based on his pose in his
Original splash art
.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
original icon of
Feral Scream
was used to represent the "General Discussion" section.
In the official League of Legends game
trailer
from 2009, Cho'Gath was given generic T-Rex sounds.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch;
The following changes regarding Cho'Gath were jokingly listed：
Cho'Gath now starts the game the same size as if he had 6
feasts
.
Feast
still increases Cho'Gath's size.
Bushes
can no longer
stealth
Cho'Gath.
The following joke item was listed to be added:
NEW Yordle Saddle: Any
yordle
champion can buy this new item to ride Cho'Gath.
Cho'Gath was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Big Stompy Monster" (along with its huge variant) in
Invasion
, a
featured game mode
.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Ward
Wards
are deployable units that that grant

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration
is affected by
Tenacity

The
strength
is reduced by

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.
"
Cleanse
" does not always refer to the act of removing
all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.
A
cleanse
does not remove
Stasis
, but will remove the disable portion of
Airborne

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the

Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks

skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras

It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
