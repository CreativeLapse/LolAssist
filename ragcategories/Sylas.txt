stack from casting
Hijack
is given after
Sylas
receives the Hijacked ability.
Hijack'
s per target cooldown is indicated by a ring under recently targetted enemy champions, and is only visible to
Sylas
and each individual enemy.
If
Sylas
casts
Hijack
on a
clone
, no ultimate is stolen and the ability will be placed on full cooldown.
The same does not occur for champions within a
zombie state
.
Clones
do not copy
Hijack's
target cooldown indicator, potentially revealing them to
Sylas
.
Neeko's
Inherent Glamour
does not hide her personal cooldown indicator, nor does she copy her allies'.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on
cooldown
nor pay its cost (if applicable).
If the same happens when casting an on-target stolen ability, the ability will instead cancel and go on cooldown.
If
Hijack
is intercepted by
Braum's
Unbreakable
,
Sylas
will gain a copy of
Glacial Fissure
instead and an on-target cooldown will be applied to him.
If
Braum
has an on-target cooldown on him (by being previously
Hijacked
) upon interception, no ultimate will be stolen.
Since the copied ability scales based on
Hijack's
rank, abilities can be copied regardless of their rank.
Hijack
will copy all passives, actives and recast effects of the stolen ability.
Hijack
will not trigger the effects of other abilities unless absolutely necessary.
Shape-shifting ultimates will transform
Sylas
into the target's alternate form, replacing his basic abilities and
base
stats. Namely:
Cougar Form
,
Spider Form
,
Cannon Form
and
Dragon Form
.
Dragon's Descent
transforms
Sylas'
mana
, into
Shyvana's
fury
, being able to replenishing it by basic attacking. At the end of the effect,
Sylas
gains his previous mana.
Dragon's Descent
does not refresh ability cooldowns upon transforming.
Spider Form
freezes Sylas' original cooldowns on their current values, causing them to not come off cooldown during Spider Form.
(bug)
Upon transforming back from
Cannon Form
, Sylas' next basic attack deals
Transform Mercury Hammer
's bonus magic damage and uses his critical strike animation.
Transforming into
Cannon Form
with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting
Hypercharge
will limit its effect until the currently held Unshackled stacks are spent.
(bug)
Transforming into
Cougar Form
with more than 2 stacks of Unshackled and then casting
Takedown
will disable Takedown's effect until the buff timer runs out.
(bug)
Permanent transformations last for ~5 minutes or until toggled off.
The alternate abilities of transforming champions will cost mana and scale with the ranks as appropriate for the ability (e.g. ranks in R for Nidalee and ranks in Q/W/E for Jayce/Elise).
Upon transforming, a
Petricite Burst
stack will be deducted.
Petricite Burst
stacks will still be gained from abilities cast in alternate forms, but the stacks are gained independently from the normal ones.
If
Sylas
has both normal and transformed stacks,
Petricite Burst
will prioritize consuming
Sylas
stacks before the transformed ones.
Ultimates comply with
One for All
rules if an ally is playing the hijacked champion. For example, an allied
Darius'
Hemorrhage
stacks will increase the damage of the hijacked
Noxian Guillotine
; or an allied
Syndra's
Dark Sphere
will add extra damage to hijacked
Unleashed Power
as well as producing 3 spheres that she can use.

Raised in one of Demacia’s lesser quarters, Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolize the darker side of the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served… and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day.

The hateful lord of the lunar wraiths, Sylas has waited eons to invade the heavenly realm, and depose its godly stewards. What happens to the balance between heaven and earth is not his concern; he simply craves chaos, and the hour of his triumph is fast approaching.

Free from the kingdom that once imprisoned him, Sylas of Dregbourne marches from Demacia to the Freljord. With every step he takes, he remembers what others have branded him: Mage, Traitor, Kingslayer—names he revels in as he endures the bitter cold, his heart warmed by the fires of rebellion. It will be here, in the icy north, that he will seize the ancient power needed to fuel his revolution…

A self-styled leader of the outcasts who live beyond the city's walls, Sylas has heeded Ashe's call and rallied the Renegades in defense of the City. Though his true motives are the collapse of PROJECT and the capital surveillance state, for now he's content destroying the armies of a dangerous rogue AI.

With the Outcasts, G/Netic, and PROJECT itself faced with an insurmountable enemy, each faction turns to dangerous experimental technologies and long-lost robotics of a past age, hoping for an edge. Sylas, however, had a plan all along—integrating jailbroken corporate upgrades for the ultra-wealthy, so he can one day turn them on PROJECT.

Sylas deeply loved magic, but long years of imprisonment made him hateful. As a knight, he deigned to take as much power for himself as he could, and perhaps become a new wellspring of enchantment… yet, it was all for naught. Now only the dying shadow of magic remains, with he its final, bitter champion.

The disgraced inventor, Sylas, had long harbored a grudge against Polaris and had prepared a special device for this occasion: gauntlets capable of absorbing the Aurora. He'd tested it on Hwei earlier, but now turned his focus to Polaris. Powerless to resist, Senna's power was taken away, to be spread among Sylas, Camille, and Thresh.

Sylas is a corruptant of the Dark Star, born from a civilization of shackles that was silenced in a collective cry for justice that never came. He lays low the forces of creation and destruction in an endless quest to destroy any and all structures of power. Heedless of morality, he seeks only to equalize the universe.

Burst
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Burst Mages
aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.
Examples
Annie
Syndra
Veigar
League of Legends content
Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Minion
Minions
are autonomous units that spawn periodically from their nexus and advance along the lanes toward the enemy nexus. They
basic attack
any enemy unit or structure they find in their way, but can be killed for
gold
.
There are four kind of
minions
:
melee minions
,
caster minions
,
siege minions
and
super minions

League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.

Iceborn Gauntlet

League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil
.
League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind

Effects that

damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable

Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always

Dodge

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
