STATIC COOLDOWN
:
300
RANGE:
700
Innate - Goo:
Zac's
abilities have a
health cost
. Whenever
Zac's
abilities damage an enemy, he sheds a number of chunks on the ground that remain for a few seconds.
Zac
and enemy champions can collect the chunks; an enemy will destroy it, while
Zac
will
heal
a portion of
his
maximum
health
.
Innate:
Periodically when
Zac
would die, he instead enters
resurrection
for a period, splitting into four
bloblets
that can be attacked by enemies.
Zac
will
die
once all
bloblets
are killed.
Innate - The Secret Weapon:
Zac
gains increased percentage
size
equal to
1.
5
% of his
bonus
health
, capped at 35% increased size at
2333.
3
3
bonus
health
.
Zac's
size also reduces based on his
missing
health
, down to 70%
total
size while at
0% health
.
Innate - Goo:
Whenever
Zac
damages at least one enemy with an
ability
, he sheds a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards nearby
visible
enemy
champions
and lasting for 6 seconds.
Stretching Strikes
: 1 chunk for each strike hit (excluding the collision) on different targets, up to 2
Unstable Matter
: 1 chunk if it hits at least one target
Elastic Slingshot
: 1 chunk for each enemy champion hit
Let's Bounce!
: 1 chunk for each bounce that hits an enemy champion, up to 4
Both
Zac
and enemy champions can interact with a chunk by being within 50 units of it: an enemy will destroy it, while
Zac
will consume it to
heal
for
4% − 8% (based on level)
of his
maximum
health
.
Innate - Cell Division:
Periodically, upon taking
fatal damage
,
Zac
enters
resurrection
for
8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level)
seconds, instantly restoring
50% of his
maximum
health
and becoming
untargetable
and
unable to act
for the duration.
Zac
then splits into four uncontrollable
bloblets
away from his location, though stopping at terrain. After 1.
5
seconds of the
bloblets
being
untargetable
, they start moving toward
Zac's
location over the
remaining duration
. Any damage the
bloblets
receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of each of their
total
health
, is also redirected to
Zac
as
true damage
. While in resurrection,
Zac
cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his
bloblets
.
After the duration,
Zac
is revived with
10 – 50%
maximum
health
.
Zac
will die once all bloblets are killed.
See
Pets
for stats and details for bloblets.
Info
Targeting input
Passive
Damage type
Type
The damage directed to
Zac
is
internal raw damage
.
Zac's
health when the
bloblets
are sent out is set to what it would be if all
bloblets
recombined, and is actively updated when the
bloblets
take damage.
Zac's
increased size does not consider his base stats.
Cell Division's
chunks
spawn in two versions:
Contestable:
They will fall to the ground at a point which is roughly equidistant from
Zac
and the nearest
visible
enemy champion within 1000 range of him (dropping slightly in
Zac's
favor). The location at which they fall to the ground is influenced by the direction in which
Zac
is currently facing. Cannot be interacted with for the first 0.
25
seconds (except during
Let's Bounce!
).
Uncontestable:
They will fall to the ground near
Zac
and can be picked up immediately (version used by default).
Zac's
untargetability
upon triggering
Cell Division
does not
destroy
in-flight
projectiles
.
Chronoshift
and
Guardian Angel
will take priority over
Cell Division
.
Spirit Visage
and
Heal Power
increases the healing of both
chunks
and
bloblets
.
Ryze's
Realm Warp
is able to individually teleport
Zac
or his
bloblets
during
Cell Division
.
If
Zac
is transported to a new location before the
bloblets
landed, they will travel to form at his new position, adjusting their speed accordingly. If
Cell Division's
duration permits during this time,
Zac
will be revived even if the
bloblets
fail to physically recombine.
Cell Division's
bloblets
can be targeted by
Teleport
and
Syndra's
Force of Will
.
Other
bloblets
are not interrupted by the conditions above and will continue to recombine instinctively.
If
Zac's
health is higher than it is supposed to be when the
bloblets
converge on him, his health will be set to the correct value.

magic damage
and
knocking them up
and
stunning
them for 0.

magic damage
.

The following features were added in patch
V7.10
to increase
Stretching Strikes'
reliability and usability:
If the second attack's target would die from the damage, it won't be dealt until they are slammed to the first target.
If the first target is standing on top of other enemies, the second hit will reliably choose a different target from the first.
Non-champion units that are affected by
Stretching Strikes'
displacement are prevented from taking any damage until they are slammed together. Note that this often confuses players who are trying to secure
monsters
via
Smite
while
Zac
is slamming the wanted target, resulting in
Smite
dealing no damage to it. It is currently unknown whatever the side effects of this feature are intentional or not.
Spell shields
will block a single instance of damage only.
If the tethered target is
untargetable
during the second
Stretching Strike
via basic attack, they are completely unaffected by the ability.
Displacement immunity
will also resist the application of the
stun
.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away during the empowered attack's cast time, it is cancelled but not consumed.

Zac is the product of a toxic spill that ran through a chemtech seam and pooled in an isolated cavern deep in Zaun’s Sump. Despite such humble origins, Zac has grown from primordial ooze into a thinking being who dwells in the city’s pipes, occasionally emerging to help those who cannot help themselves or to rebuild the broken infrastructure of Zaun.

Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters

Health
Some champions use
Health
as a resource to cast abilities.
While these champions can cast their abilities more freely than most, their disadvantage is that frequent ability usage will bring them closer to taking
fatal damage
.
Health costs
ignore
invulnerability
as well as effects that
prevent
falling below a certain health value.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Raw damage
Raw damage
is a type of damage that normally ignores resistances,
shields
, and
minimum health threshold
and
resurrection
effects on the target.
Invulnerability
and
spell shields
,  where applicable, are the only ways to reduce or negate
raw damage
. Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against an enemy always deal more than
100% of the target's
current
health
(
"execution damage"
). Current champion-sources of
raw damage
against the player's own champion or an ally are special-cased to take place during effects that protect champions from death. Current implementations of
minimum health thresholds
are special-cased to leave units at
1 health
rather than the threshold, when they are dealt lethal
raw damage
.
Raw damage
does not interact with
any
effect.
Internal raw
damage is a form of
raw damage
that also bypasses
invulnerability
and has no overrides in place to prevent it from killing death-protected champions. The
Nexus Obelisk
,
Zac's
Cell Division
redirected damage, and
Rift Herald's
self-damage also have this modified form.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall

Blade Whirl

projectile popping events

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing
, and
Quicksilver
, remove the
airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
