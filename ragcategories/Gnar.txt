Rage Gene
Gnar
generates
Rage
while fighting. At maximum
Rage
, his next ability will be
Mega Gnar's
as he transforms, losing
Mini Gnar's
passive effects in exchange for increased stats and new abilities.
Mega Gnar
form lasts for some time before reverting to
Mini Gnar
, afterwards he cannot generate
Rage
for some time.
Innate - Rage Gene:
Mini Gnar
generates
4 / 7 / 11 (based on level)
Rage
over 2 seconds upon dealing or receiving damage. Against non-champions,
basic attacks
and
Boomerang Throw
instantly generate
「

875

Rage
. 」
「 12.

Against champions,
Boomerang Throw
instantly generates
「
1 / 1.
75
/ 2.
75
(based on level)
Rage
, 」
「 25% of the amount, 」
and basic attacks instantly generate
「
2 / 3.
5
/ 5.
5
(based on level)
. 」
「 50% of the amount. 」
Boomerang Throw
can only generate
Rage
once per cast, and grants
Rage
based on the first enemy hit.
Gnar's
Rage
decays after being
out of combat
for 13 seconds.
At maximum
Rage
,
Gnar's
abilities are switched to
Mega Gnar's
abilities for 4 seconds. Casting one of
Mega Gnar's
abilities will cause him to transform into
Mega Gnar
, else he will transform automatically after the 4 seconds have elapsed.
Gnar's
Mega
form lasts for 15 seconds, with his
Rage
bar depleting as an indication of remaining time.
Rage cannot be generated while in this form.
Afterwards,
Gnar
returns to
Mini Gnar
, retaining his
current
percentage health
and becoming too
tired
to generate
Rage
for 15 seconds.
Gnar
gains different stat bonuses based on whether he is in
Mini
or
Mega
form. Both of
Gnar's
forms share their ability cooldowns.
"GNAR!"
Info
Targeting input
Passive
The
Rage
generated upon dealing or receiving damage occurs over 2 seconds with 4 ticks every 0.
5
seconds. It also does not stack but instead refreshes with subsequent applications (of dealing or receiving damage).
The bonus rage generation on basic attacks counts as an
on-hit
effect, and is triggered by
Runaan's Hurricane
and
Guinsoo's Rageblade
.
In-game, the value on the
Rage
bar always displays rounded down to the nearest integer.
Mega Gnar's
gained health is not affected by
healing
modifiers such as
Grievous Wounds
and those from
items
and
runes
.
When returning to
Mini Gnar
,
Gnar
will only retain his current health percentage, not current health total.
This is intentional to prevent
Gnar
from simply triggering
Rage Gene
in order to heal himself over time.
Gnar's
abilities share
cooldowns
across forms.
The final stats, after
Rage Gene
being applied, can be seen on
Mini Gnar's
and
Mega Gnar's
respective data template, in the
front page

The boomerang return direction is determined at the apex of its flight by
Gnar's
current position and which direction
Gnar
is heading at the time.
Since the cooldown between the two is shared,
Mini Gnar
may pick up a
boulder
and/or
Mega Gnar
may catch a

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

Gnar is an excitable yordle whose playful antics can erupt into a toddler’s outrage in an instant, transforming him into a massive beast bent on destruction. Frozen in True Ice for millennia, the curious creature broke free and now hops about a changed world he sees as exotic and wondrous. Delighted by danger, Gnar flings whatever he can at his enemies, be it his bonetooth boomerang… or an uprooted tree.

Some believe Gnar's wealth came from his groundbreaking research into economics and linguistics. Others question whether his investors favor him purely for his undeniable charm. Either way, he now finds himself receiving award after award—the latest being a sculpture of him in ice, rumored to never melt.

Gnar can't resist the call of a tussle in fresh powder, but woe to those who forget what they're dealing with. Mega Gnar lurks just beneath the surface, ready to take the snowball fight to the next level... and rip someone in half.

Stories have long been told of a monster that stalks the wood, rending massive oak trees asunder bare-handed—but few realize this titan is also the small, curious creature that collects baubles and bones and chitters through the treetops. The wise leave both to their devices. The foolish? Well, it depends which Gnar they meet.

Abandoned to the streets, Gnar spent years scraping by, snarling at his misfortune, until he was found by a gentle orphaned girl. What started as simple gifts of food blossomed into a loving friendship, only for Gnar to suddenly fall ill and pass. Because of their familial love, Gnar now returns as an Eidola Vida, ready to protect his family from danger.

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
Gnar,
Elise
,
Nidalee
,
Jayce
, and
Kayle
are the only champions to be conditionally considered both
ranged
and
melee
.
Gnar's concept is built on monstrous transformations in fiction coupled with the
Fish Out of Water
trope.
Inspirations include
Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
by
Robert Louis Stevenson
,
Gremlins
, and
Hulk
by
Marvel Comics
.
Paleontologically speaking, Gnar is not a missing link, i.e.
transitional specimen
, but he belongs to the Yordle population ancestral to modern ones; colloquially-speaking, he is the great-great-...-granduncle of all living Yordles.
In Brazilian localization, Gnar's title was changed to
O Yordle Pré-histórico
('the Prehistoric Yordle') in order to avoid matchmaking-rating-associated jokes/bullying derived from
O Elo Perdido
('the Missing Link').
Gnar is the second champion to have two champion portraits (
Mini Gnar
and
Mega Gnar
) the first being
Quinn
and
Valor
.
He is also the third to have more than one chat name, the first being
Anivia
and
Eggnivia
and the second being anyone polymorphed by
Lulu
(
Squill
).
As well as the seventh champion to have more than four abilities, the others being
Elise
,
Heimerdinger
,
Jayce
,
Karma
,
Nidalee
,
Lee Sin
,
Rek'Sai
and
Yorick
.
Mini Gnar has the fewest active abilities of any ranged champion (
Hyper
and
GNAR!
are fully passive effects) and the lowest health at Level 18 (1645).
Mega Gnar has his own separate emotes from Mini Gnar's.
His dance references
Donkey Kong
.
Boulder Toss
' projectile is shaped like the
Riot Games Inc.
logo.
Mega Gnar has the highest
level 18
base
attack damage
(157).
Although patch
V7.16
made it so the portrait of the selected skin would be used in the central portion of the in-game UI, transforming into
Mega Gnar
always uses his base portrait for all skins.
Hop
has the shortest ability name at 3 characters long.
For contrast,
Life Form Disintegration Ray
is the longest ability name at 28 characters long, exceeding
Hop
by 25 characters.

Fury
Fury
is an umbrella term for many named resources that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
or
Energy
that exist in some quantity beforehand. For most users, this resource is only required by a single ability or passive effect.
It represents
momentum
and encourages sustained aggression from users, often gating a power-spike or empowerment.
Fury
generation varies between users, but is always generated
in-combat
(e.g. on-hit, ability casts or taking damage) and often decays when out of combat.

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
Vanguards
are offensive tanks. Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at bringing the action. Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to follow-up to devastating effect.

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

slowed
.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
