Sovereign's Domination
Innate:
Scoring an enemy champion
takedown
will spawn a
Mist Wraith
for a period.
Viego
can consume the
Mist Wraith
to briefly become
untargetable
and
blink
to it, which
heals
him for a portion of the
target's
maximum
health
and grants
Possession
. Casting
Heartbreaker
or consuming a
Mist Wraith
will end
Possession
early.
Possession:
For a period,
Viego's
items, stats, basic attacks, and basic abilities become those of the slain enemy's. He also gains a free cast of
Heartbreaker
and
bonus
movement speed
while facing an enemy champion.
Innate:
Whenever
Viego
scores an enemy champion
takedown
while alive and within 3 seconds of damaging them, a
Mist Wraith
spawns from that champion's corpse for 8 seconds.
Viego
can basic attack a
Mist Wraith
to consume it: causing him to
blink
to its location after winding up for 1 second, during which he is
untargetable
(except to
turrets
) and
unable to act
. He then gains
Possession
and
heals
himself for
2%
(+ 2.
5
% per 100
bonus
AD)
(+ 2% per 100 AP)
(+ 5% per 100%
bonus
attack speed)
of the target's
maximum
health
.
Possession:
For 10 seconds,
Viego
assumes the enemy champion's form and gains their
basic attacks
,
basic abilities
,
items
, and base
stats
(based on
Viego's
level
). He also gains a free cast of
Heartbreaker
, which is initially placed on a
1.
5
-second
cooldown, and
10%
bonus
movement speed
while facing enemy champions within 2500 units.
Viego
cannot use
item actives
,
consumable items
, nor the
shop
during
Possession
. Casting
Heartbreaker
or attacking a
Mist Wraith
ends
Possession
immediately.
Viego
will preserve his
current
health percentage
between transformations.

Viego
will copy the possessed champion's ability ranks.
Viego
cannot level up their abilities with his available skill points.
Mist Wraiths
will expire when
Viego
dies, and they will not expire while he is winding up on them.
Viego
gains the bonus movement speed during possession even while moving towards nearby enemy champions that are
untargetable
.
Finishing the possessing attack against a
Mist Wraith
kills it, rewarding
Viego
an extra
3
as he becomes the target champion.
The wind up's
untargetability
does not
destroy
in-flight
projectiles
from
turrets
.
The possessed champion's abilities do not cost any
mana
or
energy
even if that specific champion normally uses either as a
casting resource
.
Alternative resources
, such as
Fury
,
Flow
, or
Health
, will still be utilized.
The current cooldowns of
Viego's
abilities will
not
be reset between transformations.
Those of the possessed champion's abilities will be reset between transformations.
This does not apply to the following long-cooldown abilities.
Viego
specifically tracks their proper cooldowns which can be seen via a buff in his hotbar for each when applicable.
Anivia's
Rebirth
Azir's
Shurima's Legacy
Zac's
Cell Division
The passive cooldowns of items are shared between
Viego's
and the possessed champion's.
This does not apply to
Lifeline
items.
(note)
Once
possession
ends,
Viego
returns to his normal state and certain effects gained from the possessed champion's abilities will be immediately removed.
Some buffs will be kept and some buffs will be lost.
Viego
will almost always keep
shields
and
spell shields
.
Passive
effects will be lost by default, as
Viego
no longer has their abilities.
Channeled abilities
maintained will be interrupted.
Toggled abilities
will be automatically toggled off.
Viego
retains his own
summoner spells
,
trinket item
, and
runes
during
possession
.
Mist Wraiths
will still spawn while
Viego
is in a zombie state.
Sovereign's Domination
will not summon a
Mist Wraith
from
clones
.
The
possession
will not expire while
Viego
is in a
zombie state
.
While in a zombie state,
Heartbreaker
is disabled.
If
Viego
enters a zombie state while winding up on a
Mist Wraith
, the possession will still last its normal duration.
(note)
The
possession
will not end prematurely if
Viego
enters
resurrection
.
The
possession
will acquire the basic abilities of shapeshifting champions (e.g.
Elise's
Spider Form / Human Form
,
Jayce's
Transform Mercury Cannon
/
Transform Mercury Hammer
, and
Nidalee's
Aspect of the Cougar
) based on which form they died as.
Mist Wraiths
are considered
clones
and can only be targeted by
Viego
.
If
Viego
possesses an enemy champion who owns
Dark Seal
or
Mejai's Soulstealer
, he will gain their
Glory
stacks for the possession.
As
Cull
tracks its progress for each player even if they do not possess the item at the time,
Viego
may discharge stacks for the benefit of
1
each per
minion
kill, and if
Viego
killed 100 minions possessing
Cull
, no matter whether bought himself or acquired via a possessed champion's inventory, he receives the
350
payout and can no longer discharge stacks.
This entire interaction does not interact with the state of the
Cull
stacks of the enemy.
The stacks shown on the item in the inventory and scoreboard may not update properly, however.
If
Viego
possesses an enemy champion who owns
Tear of the Goddess
, the stacks it has will be transferred to his
Tear of the Goddess
if he owns one.
If
Viego
possesses an enemy
Bel'Veth
, his attack speed cap will be modified to 90 permanently.
(bug)
If
Viego
possesses an enemy
K/DA Evelynn
, he will still hear
Demon Shade's
music upon discarding the possession if he does it while active.
(bug)
If
Viego
targets a
Mist Wraith
while already
untargetable
he will become targetable once again during the cast time.
(bug)
If
Viego
possesses an enemy on
Howling Abyss
, he will be able to use the
shop
upon returning to the
fountain
and discarding the possession.
(bug)
If
Viego
posesses an enemy
Naafiri
, he will keep her
Packmates
upon discarding the possession.

The mark will not be applied to the primary target struck by
Heartbreaker
, but it can triggered from it.
Blade of the Ruined King's
cast time is always 140% of the caster's attack windup time.
At base attack speed,
Viego's
attack windup is 0.
25
seconds.
An easy formula to calculate the cast time is [ 0.
23
seconds divided by
total
attack speed
].
Reducing
Viego's
attack speed via
attack speed reductions
also increases
Blade of the Ruined King's
cast time by the same fraction.
It is calculated from
Viego's
total attack speed after cap (2.5) and floor (0.2), making the maximum possible cast time
1.

Applies
area damage
for the thrust,
basic damage

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Viego
will not perform the second strike if the first attack was
dodged

, and
missed
.
If the second strike hits a dead unit,
Viego
will still
heal
based on the post-mitigation damage that he would deal with it.

Once ruler of a long-lost kingdom, Viego perished over a thousand years ago when his attempt to bring his wife back from the dead triggered the magical catastrophe known as the Ruination. Transformed into a powerful, unliving wraith tortured by an obsessive longing for his centuries-dead queen, Viego now stands as the Ruined King, controlling the deadly Harrowings as he scours Runeterra for anything that might one day restore her, and destroying all in his path as the Black Mist pours endlessly from his cruel, broken heart.

Former leader of a past Lunar Ox Squad, Viego decided that they would fight the Lunar Beast and actually defeat it. His plan ended in tragedy as he watched the rest of his squad be devoured-- including his wife. Viego has stewed in bitterness over these losses for years, blaming everyone but himself -- including this year's Lunar Ox Squad.

The heir of Camavor, wielder of the Blade of the King, Viego longs to follow in his father's footsteps. To his advisor Kalista, his doubts were clear long before his coronation, as whispers of the sword's bond echoed throughout the Sanctum of Judgement. But he wears the Argent Crown, and with his blade, Sanctity, Viego will strike fear into the enemies of his nation.

The gracious—if needlessly reclusive—host of the Tournament of Souls welcomes all to his arena! Look at him now, eyeing the competition from his throne room high above the ring! Doesn't his solitude just make ya sad, folks? Here's hoping he hops down from that tower and turns that sorrow into UNBRIDLED RAGE! Viiiiieeeeeeegoooooo!

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Viego's visuals were first revealed in the
Ruined King
announcement trailer
, however the character has existed since 2012 in the
Twisted Treeline
remake.
His champion theme features a segment of the song
Blade of the Ruined King
by
Pentakill
.
Viego
is possibly inspired by the Spanish word
viejo
(lit. "old") and the name
Diego
, as his kingdom appears to be inspired by
Spain
and
Camelot
.
[2]
There are also the Spanish surname
Viego
[3]
and parish
Viego
in northern Spain.
Isolde
(~
Iseult
) referrences
Iseult of Ireland
from the chivalric romance
Tristan and Iseult
The first three new champions following Viego's release (
Gwen
,
Akshan
and
Vex
) were directly tied to his return and continued his story with each release.
[4]
Viego's placeholder was a purple
Jarvan IV
during his development, due to the similarity between the length of their lance and sword.
[5]
Viego,
Blitzcrank
,
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Sion
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Xerath
, and
Ziggs
are the only champions who can apply
crowd control
on themselves.

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Takedown
Takedown
refers to a
kill
or
assist
being acceptable, with the type of enemy specified in each use case.
Takedown
is associated with triggering a
passive
effect, or timed effects shortly after scoring.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Lockout
A champion that is

Homing projectile destruction
Destroying
or
popping of a projectile
references an effect that destroys all homing
missiles
currently targeting a specific unit, such as ranged projectile-based
basic attacks
. Destroyed missiles will do the same thing as if they were destroyed by
Wind Wall
or
Blade Whirl
(usually vanishing without any effect).
The following abilities perform one or more
projectile popping events
:
Most
abilities and effects that grant
untargetability
pop projectiles when the unit gains the status effect.
Master Yi's
Alpha Strike
in particular pops targeted projectiles on each game tick for its duration.
Gwen's
Hallowed Mist
pops all projectiles (from enemy champions outside of its area of effect) targeted at her that attempt to pass through or be inside its area of effect.

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster

) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Energy
Energy
is a resource designed to limit how much a champion is able to use their
basic
abilities during a set time frame rather than through the use of
mana
. It is represented by a
yellow
bar instead of
blue
.
Energy
has a maximum of
200
(except for
Shen
, with
400
), and regenerates rapidly, at a rate of
10 energy
per second. This means that energy champions are not at risk of depleting their resource over a long period of time, however the small capacity restricts the rapid usage of multiple spells.

Fury
Fury
is an umbrella term for many named resources that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
or
Energy
that exist in some quantity beforehand. For most users, this resource is only required by a single ability or passive effect.
It represents
momentum
and encourages sustained aggression from users, often gating a power-spike or empowerment.
Fury
generation varies between users, but is always generated
in-combat
(e.g. on-hit, ability casts or taking damage) and often decays when out of combat.

Flow
Flow
is a resource that must be generated before being usable, compared to
Mana
that exists in some quantity beforehand. It is represented beneath the
health bar
that is
blue
until filled, and then
white
. Unlike
Fury
and its variants, however,
Flow
is not affected by the unit's
combat status
. With only one example of
Flow
, the validity of this exception may be called into question in the future.

Health
Some champions use
Health
as a resource to cast abilities.
While these champions can cast their abilities more freely than most, their disadvantage is that frequent ability usage will bring them closer to taking
fatal damage

Health costs
ignore
invulnerability
as well as effects that
prevent
falling below a certain health value.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels

Clone
A
clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet
that attempts to imitate a
champion
, copying their current vitality, stats, items, level, and most status effects upon creation. They are considered champions against many effects that do not strictly require
player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.
The
damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a

Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion
after
Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
. It prevents enemies from gaining full kill credit or triggering most on-kill effects from the champion a second time, and some abilities (e.g.
You and Me!
) interact differently with champions in this state.

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
