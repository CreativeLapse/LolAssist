Aurelion Sol once graced the vast emptiness of the cosmos with celestial wonders of his own devising. Now, he is forced to wield his awesome power at the behest of a space-faring empire that tricked him into servitude. Desiring a return to his star-forging ways, Aurelion Sol will drag the very stars from the sky, if he must, in order to regain his freedom.

An ancient spirit that has been making contracts with mortals through tattoos for centuries, Aurelion Sol grants inhuman power in exchange for the life force of his pawns, letting them slowly waste away until they inevitably succumb to his appetite. There is always another conflict, another war—so he has grown powerful on their deals, ever feeding.

When the Zodiac forged their relics, Aurelion Sol was there. With him, eleven others: the first to be humbled with the task of guarding the artifacts, the first to be granted their powers. Centuries later, Aurelion Sol is summoned forth by his draconic descendant, desperate for his help against an ancient threat with which he is all too familiar.

Trivia
[

]
Aurelion Sol
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Bard
,
Bel'Veth
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Nasus
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
,
Thresh
, and
Veigar
.
In Aurelion Sol's case,
Stardust
stacks gained through
Cosmic Creator
permanently increases
Breath of Light
's bonus
magic damage
,
Astral Flight
's range,
Singularity
's outer and inner radius and execution threshold and
Falling Star
and
The Skies Descend
's effect radius.
The Skies Descend
was named after his champion spell of the same
15
name
in
Legends of Runeterra
.
In 'Aurelion Sol: The Star Forger Returns' his hand gesture resembles the old
Riot Games Inc.
fist intro.
A lot of his animations and visual effects were inspired by
celestial objects
and
atoms
.
Aurelion Sol's lower body is not part of his in-game
hitbox
, which is why it is semi-transparent.
A demonstration can be seen
here
.
Prior to his CGU, in
Ultra Rapid Fire
his
Center of the Universe
passive used to have 6 stars orbiting around him with increased speed, simply by leveling up.
Interestingly, this is the only non-stat modification made to any champion in URF, suggesting this may have originally been an intended feature which was scrapped from the champion before release.
The name of the concept character from which Aurelion Sol spurred from, ​​​​​​
Ao Shin
, could be a reference to
Ao Qin
, the
Dragon King
of the
South Sea
.

Battlemage
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Battlemages
(also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.

Middle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Mid Laner
is the champion assigned to the mid lane.
Burst Mages
,
Artillery Mages
, and
Assassins
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Mid Laner
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee

Taunt

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Persistent area damage
Persistent area damage
is technically not a separate type of damage, but rather a hybrid classification that is applied to some spells.
In situations where
persistent damage
and
area damage
would have conflicting outputs, the conflict is resolved by choosing the weakest possible outcome.
Physical vamp
and
Spell vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness, as with
area damage
.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 5%, as with
persistent damage
, per target affected.
Counter Strike
reduces the damage dealt by 25%, as with
area damage

spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Takedown
Takedown
refers to a
kill
or
assist

Takedown
is associated with triggering a
passive
effect, or timed effects shortly after scoring.

Unobstructed vision
A unit with
unobstructed sight
can see the full circle of their
vision
radius, ignoring all obstructions and being able to see into terrain. This effect does not allow the user to see into
brush
, although they will be able to see beyond the brush if within range.
Having
unobstructed sight
will benefit all forms of vision, including
true sight
and
camouflage
detection - i.e. you will be able to reveal stealthed units over walls where usually terrain would block true sight.
Nearsight
prevents this vision entirely; the user's sight radius will not infiltrate beyond terrain.
League of Legends content
Knockdown
Knockdown
only affects units that are performing a
dash
or being displaced by an
airborne
effect. A unit that is
knocked down
has its
dash
or
displacement
interrupted and is placed on the ground instantly.
Knockdown
is not a
status effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts all
dashes
and
airborne effects
(displacement
and
status effects).
Knock ups
will not have their
airborne
status removed if there is no sourced debuff, but their displacement still ends.
Reduction:
The effect is instantaneous.
There is nothing to reduce.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
and
displacement immunity
.
Removal:
The effect is instantaneous.
There is nothing to remove.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Ground
A unit that is
grounded
is unable to activate movement spells for the duration. This effect does not innately
knockdown
a target that is already performing a dash.
Grounded
units can still be displaced.
Movement spells
include all
dash
and
blink
abilities - including
Recall
/
Empowered Recall
and the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Dash
, plus a number of additional cases.
Ground
is the only type of
crowd control
that is most commonly found in persistent area of effects, which will reapply the status effect continuously.
Interrupts:
Interrupts

Resist:
Resisted by

Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Kinematics
A unit that is under the effect of
kinematics
will be continually dragged to a specific unit or location until they reach it.
Kinematics
has no effect on units that are performing any form of movement other than basic movement and other
kinematic
effects.
Kinematics
should not be confused as an
airborne
effect nor displacement effect. It does not disable any of the unit's actions.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent the unit from effectively
pathing
to their intended location through basic movement.
Reduction:
The effect is instantaneous.
There is nothing to reduce.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
and
displacement immunity
.
Removal:
Removed by leaving the source of the area of effect. The effect is instantaneous.
There is nothing to cleanse.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Execute
Executes
deal
true damage
equal to
100% of the target's
current
health
through the
raw damage
source type, ignoring all mitigations.
They do not bypass
invulnerability
and effects that prevent falling below a health amount, unless the source type is
internalraw

League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Edge range
Edge range

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center

abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large

Howling Abyss
The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
Freljord
