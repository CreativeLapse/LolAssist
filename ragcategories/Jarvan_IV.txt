Prince Jarvan, scion of the Lightshield dynasty, is heir apparent to the throne of Demacia. Raised to be a paragon of his nation’s greatest virtues, he is forced to balance the heavy expectations placed upon him with his own desire to fight on the front lines. Jarvan inspires his troops with his fearsome courage and selfless determination, raising his family’s colors high and revealing his true strength as a future leader of his people.

The Hextech Renaissance appealed not only to those with backgrounds in science, but also to those looking for an escape from their day-to-day lives. For the young Prince Jarvan, it presented the chance to enhance his martial skill—with technology that would have never been accepted within his father's kingdom.

Jarvan IV's stubborn refusal to join Ox Clan only relented to his father's stubborn insistence. Though he tries his best to shirk the celebrity status that comes with the role, Jarvan comes from a long line of philanthropists, and has found himself caught up in the thrill of bringing businesslike efficiency to the biggest community event of the year.

Jarvan is the magnetism of chaos made real. Like the eye of a hurricane, his destruction inevitably sweeps up anyone and anything in his path. To him, chaos is the forge from which true gods are made, and only those that survive the war will be worthy to live in the new age of creation that follows.

Trivia
[

|
edit source
]
Jarvan IV was first mentioned in
Urgot's
lore.
A tab for Jarvan IV can be faintly seen at the top during
Maokai's
Art Spotlight
.
In-universe Demacian naming convention does not mirror real-life's European royalty and nobility's naming convention; as the current Jarvan should not have gotten the
regnal number
IV
before his coronation.
The terrain created by
Cataclysm
is made of 24 minions to make sure that no one can squeeze through the wall.
[2]
The old visual effects of
Golden Aegis
was once made up of little ghosts due being a recolored copy of
Death's Caress
.

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins

Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike

Ground
A unit that is
grounded
is unable to activate movement spells for the duration. This effect does not innately

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed

Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
. Shield reduction effects, exclusively

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
