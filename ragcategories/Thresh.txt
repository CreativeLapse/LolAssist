Thresh
will track the target if they change locations.
He will dash to the target's previous location if the target is too far away or moves beyond
2000
units.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Thresh
will not tug if the target is too close to him.
Thresh
will turn his facing direction towards the cast direction only after
Death Sentence's
cast is complete.
If
Thresh
is facing
more
than 90° away from the cast direction in either direction, he will turn to face
exactly
90° away from the cast direction over the cast time, then turn towards the cast direction when the missile is fired.
If
Thresh
is facing
less
than 90° away from the cast direction, he will keep his facing direction until the missile is fired.
This prevents the enemy from knowing where exactly
Thresh
is aiming at before the cast animation is complete.
Death Sentence
triggers on-cast effects (such as
Spellblade
and triggering
Force Pulse's
passive) once at the start of the cast, and once at the end of the cast. It may trigger on-cast effects a third time when casting
Deathly Leap
.
This is because a separate spell is cast to prevent
Thresh
from facing towards the target direction immediately, which is (incorrectly) flagged to trigger on-cast effects.
(bug)
Deathly Leap
has a maximum cast range. If
Thresh
or his victim move too far away from one another,
Death Sentence
will show its cooldown prematurely, preventing
Deathly Leap
from being cast.
This behaves similarly to a tether range.
If
Thresh
is already outside the maximum range when the scythe lands and the
hook
is created,
Death Sentence
will not be on cooldown
(bug)
, however actually casting
Deathly Leap
will cause it to fizzle unless
Thresh
has walked into range again.
Death Sentence
cannot be recast while
grounded
or
rooted
.
Death Sentence
can be recast even while the target is
untargetable
.
Only
Death Sentence's
first chain tug puts the target
airborne
. Outside the first ~0.
3
seconds, the target is only stunned.
(bug)
Death Sentence
will not
stun
enemies that are
displacement immune
or
immune to crowd control
but the target will still be
hooked
and
Thresh
is still granted the ability to recast for his dash.
Thresh
will not tug at all if the
stun
is not active on the target or if he used the recast.
Spell shield
will block all of
Death Sentence's
effects, including the
hook
as well as prevent the cooldown reduction.
Death Sentence's
stun
duration is affected by
tenacity
but the
hook
will always persist for 1.
5
seconds, unless the target uses a
cleansing
effect, in which case the
hook
is removed.
Death Sentence's
stun
will persist even if
Thresh
dies before the duration ends. The tug will not occur as
Thresh
is not alive.

Tips & Tricks
Since the ally needs to select the lantern, enemies may create targetable units on top of the lantern to impede allies from grabbing it (i.e

).

Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is an ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles. Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, he was undone by a power greater than life or death, and now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond their brief mortal coil as Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his unholy lantern to torture for all eternity.

As paradoxes multiply and more rogue agents rebel against the grasp of the chrono-enforcers, Thresh, as commander of the Rembrancers, takes matters into his own hands. He must not yield control of time to these interlopers… nor to the growing Praetorian threat.

Some are destined to rule. Others hear only echoes of glory, knowing nothing of the sacrifices that must be made! You must put your empire before EVERYTHING... even the lives of your subjects. The Emperor Thresh still guides his people, their souls forever safe, though their bodies were washed away. Someday, he'll heal his broken empire. All he needs is a kind empress' helping hand.

Thresh, Sylas, and Camille laughed as the Aurora surged within them, until the laughs turned to screams! The raw power of the Aurora was too much, killing the inventor and dancer and leaving only a corrupted Thresh behind. Believing himself to be the rightful new Polaris, he raised his weapon, ready to doom Senna... when suddenly, Lucian appeared!

There aren't many places, let alone stock brokerage firms, that will hire an ethically questionable, skull-faced custodian named Thresh, but Mundo wouldn't be a trillionaire if he didn't know a good bet when he saw one. Who better to clean up dirty money than a demon janitor?

Thresh
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bard
,
Bel'Veth
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Nasus
,
Senna
,
Shyvana
,
Sion
,
Smolder
,
Swain
,
Sylas
, and
Veigar
.
In Thresh's case,
Damnation
infinitely stacks his
ability power
and
armor
.
Thresh's name originated from the verb for harvesting (souls).
[2]
He may also be named after
Dennis 'Thresh' Fong
, who popularized WASD movement keys and is considered the first professional gamer.
Thresh was the first
champion
to:
Be released in
2013
.
His base
health
at
level
18 was also 2013 on release.
Cost
7800
on
first week after release
.
Feature
ranged
non-projectile
basic attacks
.
Feature an
attack windup
modifier (of 0.25).
Feature a
Respawn
animation on the Classic skin.
Thresh and
Urgot
used to be the only champions classified as
ranged
tanks
before having their roles changes in 2013.
Thresh has three different sets of basic attack animations depending on how far he is from the target he is hitting (melee, mid-range, full attack range).
Thresh's dance references
Poi
dancing
(he swings his
scythe
and
lantern
, or his scythe and the lantern's hook if he cast
Dark Passage
before dancing).
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Dark Passage
is the eldest ability that grants an allied displacement.
Thresh's theme references
Rain Rain Go Away
and/or
Ring a Ring o' Roses
.
Death Recap
used to read
"You have opened
The Box
. Your prize: death"
.
If
Senna
and Thresh are played on opposing teams, a
quest
will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the opposing champion's stack of souls.

Catcher
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Catchers
specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.
Examples
Blitzcrank
Morgana
Zyra
League of Legends content
Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Tank (Legacy)
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
