Noxious Blast
always uses
quick cast
, regardless of player settings.
The damage inflicted by
Noxious Blast
is calculated as follows: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer.
For example: with
0
bonus
AP
Noxious Blast
inflicts 75 damages over 7 ticks of damage, so 75/7 (≈10.71) deals first of all 10 damage, then (2 × 75/7)  −  10 (≈11.43) deals in a second time 11 damages, then (3 × 75/7)  −  10  −  11 (≈11.14) deals in a third time 11 damages, and so on.
The damage displayed for
Noxious Blast
DOT (
Damage_over_time
) always remains constant and corresponds to the previously mentioned formula: damage / 7 ticks rounded down to the nearest integer. It's important not to confuse the consistent displayed damage with the actual damage, which is updated with each tick, see
tick and updates
.
With the same example as above, the damage displayed is always 10.
Occasionally,
Noxious Blast
may not deal the displayed damage. This discrepancy occurs when the calculated damage falls between 0.5 and 1. In such cases, rounding to the nearest integer, specifically rounding up, creates a 1-point difference. It's important to note that the damage is rounded down to the nearest integer.
For example: with a
Blasting Wand's
,
Noxious Blast
shows  so rounded to the nearest integer 116 magic damage, but really deals using the formula above 115 magic damage.
(bug)
When
Cassiopeia
has precisely
20
bonus
AP
or
40
bonus
AP
. In this scenario,
Noxious Blast
may inflict 1 less damage than intended. Importantly, this bug occurs independently of rounding considerations.
PENDING FOR TEST:
Enemies within the blast of
Noxious Blast
are
poisoned
for something between 3.
2
and 3.
3
seconds.

Twin Fang's
cast indicator is incorrectly adding her own radius to the range like an
edge range
ability, and is therefore slightly larger than the actual cast range
Twin Fang
can cast at.
Using
Twin Fang
on an out-of-range target after completing a movement order causes
Cassiopeia
to move back to her original location after casting, if no other order is issued during the entire process.
(note)
This may be a consequence of
Twing Fang
being a "Walk in range of the target" ability that does not interrupt movement.
If an out-of-range target becomes invalid,
Cassiopeia
continues to walk toward their last known location.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on
cooldown
nor pay its cost (if applicable).

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
Petrifying Gaze's
target direction will change if
Cassiopeia's
facing direction changes during the cast time (i.e. through
knockbacks
).
The facing direction of champions whose abilities/animations cause them to lock their facing or spin is always the direction they are moving in. For abilities that cause the champion to spin in place (e.g.
Death Lotus
,
Judgment
) it will factor the direction they were facing on cast.
Lucian's
The Culling
is an exception and his facing direction is actually considered to be the direction he is facing.

Cassiopeia is a deadly creature bent on manipulating others to her sinister will. Youngest and most beautiful daughter of the noble Du Couteau family of Noxus, she ventured deep into the crypts beneath Shurima in search of ancient power. There, she was bitten by a gruesome tomb guardian, whose venom transformed her into a viper-like predator. Cunning and agile, Cassiopeia now slithers under the veil of night, petrifying her enemies with her baleful gaze.

Enterprising creatures of the Old West often fall in with more successful bandit clans, serving as nightmarish enforcers, unafraid of a little casual violence. Cassiopeia became infamous as one such outlaw, but following a bloody coup now leads an enclave of her own.

On a cliff overlooking the sea, the lonely gorgon Cassiopeia has made her home among a garden of statues of her own making. Memories of friends, enemies, and lovers passed, immortalized in stone, many eternally screaming in agony. Whispers from the local villages warn not to enter her domain, but still, visitors keep coming, all to meet the same fate.

Rumored to have once been a beautiful princess, legend says Cassiopeia vanished into the mountains when her sister staged a coup, never to return. So great was her beauty, and so renowned her cunning, that a shrine was built to honor this 'spirit of temptation', until her story was accepted into popular folklore.

Trivia
Cassiopeia was the last champion released in 2010 as well as the third one to feature an '
Art Spotlight
' (hers in particular shows how her taunt was animated).
Cassiopeia's basic attack particles were snakes at release, as seen in
her
Champion Spotlight
.
Cassiopeia -
Katarina
is one of seven pairs of sibling champions (the others being
Kayle
-
Morgana
,
Garen
-
Lux
,
Nasus
-
Renekton
,
Yasuo
-
Yone
,
Darius
-
Draven
, and
Vi
-
Jinx
).
Though not a pair,
Anivia
,
Ornn
, and
Volibear
are also siblings.
Twin Fang
directly benefits from allied poison abilities in the same fashion
Last Breath
does with displacement ones.
Her name's first element derives from Hebrew קְצִיעָה‏
qeṣiah
cassia
:
Possibly from Semitic root
K-S
"cut", as the barks were scrapped from the tree's trunk;
Or borrowed from Old Chinese 桂
*kʷeːs
(> Mandarin
guì
/kʷei̯˥˩/) "
osmanthus fragrans
", by spice-merchants who imported the barks;
the suffix
-opeia
is etymologically uncertain.
The inspiration for Cassiopeia comes from mainly three sources:
Greek mythology
She shares names with
the eponymous constellation
charted by
Ptolemy
as well as
the eponymous queen
from
Greek Mythology
.
Miasma
references
the eponymous mythical disease
.
She resembles a
Gorgon
(with
Petrifying Gaze
and her death animation referencing
Medusa
) as well as a
Drakaina
.
Hellenised Ptolemaic Egypt
Her seductress background references
Cleopatra VII
.
Hers is the
the Belly Dance.

Battlemage
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Battlemages
(also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack

usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.

Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.

Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.

Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.

percentages cannot reduce a target below

Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.

on instances of
Magic damage

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
