Frost Shot
Innate - Frost Shot:

basic attacks
and

hits apply
Frost
to enemies for 2 seconds, which
slows
them by
20% − 30% (based on level)
for the duration. Basic attacks against enemies with
Frost
are modified to deal 115%
(+ (75% +
40%
) of critical strike chance)
damage.
Innate - Critical Slow:
Ashe's
critical strikes
do not deal any additional damage, instead they double
Frost's
slow strength to
40% − 60% (based on level)
, decaying over the first second of the duration to its normal strength.

Ranger's Focus
COST:

Active:

Passive:

Ashe's
basic attacks

The first attack from Ranger's Focus has 6 arrows, thus dealing 20% more total damage than expected.
Ranger's Focus
first bolt deals
basic damage
with the subsequent 4 bolts dealing a non-reactive damage type (e.g.
default damage
or
proc damage
).  The entire effect is classified as a basic attack on a
script
-level, but is considered an ability for other effects (i.e
Sap Magic
), which is likely due to a mistaken script-level tag.
Although
Ranger's Focus
has no actual cooldown, 4 stacks of focus are needed before
Ranger's Focus
can be reactivated. The time before being able to reactivate
Ranger's Focus
is
6.
08
− 1.
6
(based on attack speed)
seconds.
Each arrow from a flurry applies
Frost
and the bonus damage from
Frost Shot
is calculated individually per arrow.
Similarly, since a flurry is 5 instances of physical damage,
Black Cleaver
allows her to cleave the enemy target 5 times per flurry.
Sources of flat damage reduction against any (physical) damage such as
Amumu's
Tantrum
,
Leona's
Eclipse
or
Fizz's
Nimble Fighter
will apply the reduction to each arrow's damage, resulting in extremely reduced damaged compared to a normal attack.
Each additional arrow from
Runaan's Hurricane
will also split into 5 arrows.
The arrows are evenly distributed among secondary enemies but one enemy cannot be hit by more than 5 arrows.
The flurry will trigger on-hit effects once to each enemy hit, but no more than 3 targets per attack.
The flurry applies against
structures
. Stacks of
Focus
will not be granted when attacking structures.

Iceborn warmother of the Avarosan tribe, Ashe commands the most populous horde in the north. Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice. With her people’s belief that she is the mythological hero Avarosa reincarnated, Ashe hopes to unify the Freljord once more by retaking their ancient, tribal lands.

Magelord culture was, at the height of the empire's power, strictly segregated into brutal warrior-castes, whose rise and fall was dictated by their victories in battle. Little regard is paid to this outdated militarism now—Marauder captains like Ashe maintain power simply by instilling fear, and slaying their rivals.

Frost Shots
- Repurposed Ability
New Innate:
Ashe's
basic attacks and abilities apply
Frost
to enemies damaged, slowing them by
5 − 35 (based on level)
% for 2 seconds. Ashe's basic attacks against
frosted
units always critically strike, dealing
「
10 + (X * (1 + Y))% AD
bonus critical damage, where X is her critical strike chance and Y is her bonus critical strike damage (both in decimal format) 」
「
10% AD
bonus critical damage, plus an additional
1% AD
for every 1% of her
critical strike chance
that is modified by 1% for every 1% of her
bonus
critical strike damage
」
. Ashe cannot otherwise critically strike.
Notes:
Frosted
targets are distinct from
Slowed
targets - only Ashe's
Frost Shot
can trigger the bonus damage.
Other slows don't trigger it.
Ashe's
empowered attacks (
even the base
10% AD
with no crit chance
) are classified as critical strikes for gameplay purposes and will trigger effects such as
Frenzy
and
Reinforced Armor
.
[2]
As such, it is also not applied by
Runaan's Hurricane
.
Here are examples on the behaviour of
Frost Shot's
bonus damage.
[3]
None of the following considers the
100% AD
base damage from basic attacks.
Infinity Edge
will deal
40% AD
bonus damage (
10 + (
20
×  (1 +
0.
5
)
).
Adding a
Phantom Dancer
increases the aforementioned to
92.
5
% AD
bonus damage (
10 + (
55
×  (1 +
0.
5
)).
With 100% critical strike chance and
Infinity Edge's
bonus critical damage, you will deal
160% AD
bonus damage (
10 + (
100
×  (1 +
0.
5
)
).
Probable Bug:
Critical strike damage from runes is stacking multiplicatively with Infinity Edge, rather than additively, for a maximum of 228.
265
% bonus damage (10 + 100 × 1.
5
× 1.
4551
).
Ranger's Focus
- New Ability
Passive:
Ashe
gains a stack of
Focus
for 4 seconds whenever she slows an enemy, stacking up to 5 times.
Ashe will not generate stacks while Ranger's Focus is on cooldown.
Active:
Ashe
consumes all
Focus
stacks to gain 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 / 40% bonus attack speed and increases
Frost Shot's
slow strength
「 by 20% 」
「 to
25 − 55 (based on level)
% 」
for 4 seconds. If
Ashe
consumes 5 stacks of
Focus
on activation,
Ranger's Focus
will also cause each of Ashe's attacks to fire a flurry of five arrows, dealing
「
23 / 24 / 25 / 26 / 27%
modified attack damage with each arrow 」
「 a total of
115 / 120 / 125 / 130 / 135% attack damage
on each empowered attack 」
. The flurry will stack multiplicatively with
Frost Shots
, will benefit from
life steal
and triggers
on-attack effects
five times, but on-hit effects are only applied once.
Cost: 50 mana
Cooldown: 18 seconds
Notes:
The multi-attack effect is similar to
Lightslinger
and
Double Strike
, except that on-hit effects aren't applied by the extra attacks.
Triggering
On Attack Effects
multiple times is intentional.
[4]
- namely,
Runaan's Hurricane
and
Pix
.
Note that Pix's cannot attack more than twice per second.
On-hit effects are disabled on the latter four attacks and will not be triggered even by Runaan's minor bolts.
As such, the item's 10 on-hit damage is only applied by the first attack.
Runaan's splash damage is affected by the damage modifier - dealing
「 10
(+57.
5
/ 60 / 62.
5
/ 65 / 67.
5
AD)
damage per flurry 」
「
11.
5
/ 12 / 12.
5
/ 13 / 13.
5
% AD
damage per arrow (+ 10 on the first) 」
to secondary targets.
As with
Headshot
, attacks against structures will refresh the timer on Focus but will not generate new stacks.
The multi-attack effect will work on structures - i.e.
you will plink towers faster than
Jinx
.
Volley
Arrows increased to 9 from 7.
Radius is unaffected.
Mana cost reduced to 50 mana from 60.
Cooldown reduced to 12 / 10 / 8 / 6 / 4 seconds from 16 / 13 / 10 / 7 / 4.
New Effect:
Targets can now intercept multiple arrows, but will take no damage from arrows beyond the first.
Arrows beyond the first will still generate Focus.
Hawkshot
Passive gold generation removed.
Range increased to Global from 2500 / 3250 / 4000 / 4750 / 5500.
New Effect:
Now works with a stock system, able to hold up to two charges.
Static cooldown implemented at 5 seconds.
Recharge time increased to 90 / 80 / 70 / 60 / 50 versus the current 60 / 55 / 50 / 45 / 40 cooldown.
Enchanted Crystal Arrow
No longer innately slows, but will apply
Frost Shots'
slow.
Slow percentage effectively reduced to
5 − 35 (based on level)
(+20% during Ranger's Focus)% from 50%.
Slow duration effectively reduced to 2 from 3.

Ashe's dance references
J'en Ai Marre!
by
Alizée
.
A side by side comparison can be seen
here.
Ashe shares similarities with
Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca
from
Final Fantasy XII
. Their names are similar and both became queens, use ranged weapons (Ashelia uses hand bombs in
Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings
) and were once hunted down to prevent them from leading their respective peoples.
Ashe is the first (and so far the only) champion to possess two global-ranged abilities:
Hawkshot
and
Enchanted Crystal Arrow
.
Timewinder
and
Chronobreak's
ranges can be global, albeit situationally.
Ashe was named for
Marc 'Tryndamere' Merrill
's wife Ashley.
As of December 9, 2017 Ashe has featured on the
free champion rotation
more than any other champion (76 times).
In
Summoner's Rift
,
Thornmail
was once recommended as a situational item for
Ashe
, this was most likely a reference to the old
Basic Tutorial
where
Ashe
is pre-selected as the player's champion and
Thornmail
is the only purchasable item.
In the now-removed official League of Legends
forums
, the
old icon of
Focus
was used to represent the "New Player Forum" section.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.

Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support

vision

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.

Frost Shot
Innate - Frost Shot:
Ashe's
basic attacks apply a
slow
on-hit and cause her subsequent attacks to deal increased damage.
Innate - Critical Slow:
Ashe's
critical strikes
deal no bonus damage but apply an empowered
slow

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Script
The game has two damage systems in place: an
engine-level
system and
script-level
system. Scripts are used by most "modern" game features, such as
Runes Reforged
.
The following are engine-level damage classifications:
Raw damage
,
Default damage
,
Proc damage
,
Reactive damage
,
Basic damage
,
Spell damage
,
Area damage
,
Persistent damage
and
Pet damage
.
The following are script-level damage classifications:
AOE
,
Periodic
,
Indirect
,
BasicAttack
,
ActiveSpell
,
Proc
,
Pet
and
NonRedirectable
.
In most cases, the two systems correlate. A combination of the two systems is responsible for effects such as
persistent area damage
, with systems like
life steal
, on-hit effects and
spell vamp
being connected to the engine-level damage types and
Arcane Comet
being connected to script-level tags.
Instances where script-level tags create deviations from engine-level rules are noted in the ability-details.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Howling Abyss
The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
Freljord
. Legends say that, long ago, a great battle took place here on the narrow bridge spanning this chasm. No one remembers who fought here, or why, but it is said that if you listen carefully to the wind you can still hear the cries of the vanquished tossed howling into the Abyss.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
