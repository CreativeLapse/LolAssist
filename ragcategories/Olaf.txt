Undertow
may hit additional targets upon landing, but not targets already struck in-flight.
The axe will land approximately 50 units further than
Undertow's
target range if cast below maximum range.
The axe is stopped prematurely upon encountering
Wind Wall
or
Unbreakable
, remaining on the ground upon collision.
The timer for how long an axe stays on the ground does not begin until it has landed, thus it is possible to throw another axe before retrieving the first.
Olaf
cannot pick up an enemy
Olaf's

This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.

The health cost is equal to 30% of the

damage dealt by the ability.
Reckless Swing
can be cast even if

doesn't have the sufficient amount of health to pay for the health cost.
As with all abilities with health costs,
Reckless Swing
will not reduce
Olaf's

Reckless Swing's
health refund is considered a

Ragnarok
removes the underlying
stun
from
airborne
effects, but not the forced displacement, which requires him to use a
blink
or

ability to override it.
Ragnarok
does not bypass self or ally applied effects, unless otherwise stated. Some examples include
Zhonya's Hourglass
,
Guardian Angel
, and
Fate's Call
.
He prevents both ally and enemy
Bard
from putting him in
stasis
with
Tempered Fate
.
The ability will remain for its full duration regardless.
Ragnarok
does not negate any
debuffs
other than
crowd control
from being applied unless absolutely necessary.
The
bonus
attack damage
updates dynamically over the duration; Increases or reductions in
attack damage
after the effect has been applied will still be amplified.
The
25% attack damage
scaling amplifies the flat
attack damage
bonus
as well.
Ragnarok
will not expire during
Reckless Swing's
cast time.
Ragnarok
will not resist the displacement caused by the 10 additional
Blast Cones
spawned by
Infernal Rift
if they're triggered by
Olaf

An unstoppable force of destruction, the axe-wielding Olaf wants nothing but to die in glorious combat. Hailing from the brutal Freljordian peninsula of Lokfar, he once received a prophecy foretelling his peaceful passing—a coward's fate, and a great insult among his people. Seeking death, and fueled by rage, he rampaged across the land, slaughtering scores of great warriors and legendary beasts in search of any opponent who could stop him. Now a brutal enforcer for the Winter's Claw, he seeks his end in the great wars to come.

One by one, the horrid beasts fell to his axe, and rumors even tell of him consuming the heart of a dragon he beheaded. Truth is, this act has only fanned the fire of his rage, driving him to bring about the end of dragons.

.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Ragnarok
is named after
the eponymous events
from
Norse mythology
.
The
crowd control
removal references the
Poetic Edda
.
During development he was simply called
Enrage Barbarian
.
Olaf's name derives from
Old West Norse
ᚬᛚᛅᚠᛦ
Óláfʀ
,
[2]
.
​Many Vikings, Norse-Gaels, and Varangians bore this name and its derivatives.
His title means
"bear-sark"
, referencing the garment worn by Norse
berserkers
.
Since his lore-retconning, Olaf fears his prophesied death in peace & obscurity and instead longs for an unforgettable, glorious death in combat, inspired by the common
Indo-European
literary motif "Imperishable Glory".
[3]
Likewise,
Pantheon
challenges his opponent(s) into an epic battle.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, he was jokingly listed to receive a skin called
"Urlaf"
, referencing
Urf
.
Olaf is one of six champions who use health as a resource for abilities, the other five being
Briar
,
Dr. Mundo
,
Soraka

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Juggernauts

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Monsters

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Ghosted
A unit that is
ghosted
ignores
unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.

destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.

shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Cleanse
A unit that is
cleansed
has all applicable
crowd control
status effects removed.
Due to the nature of the
cleanse
interaction, cleansing abilities and effects remain castable in circumstances that would otherwise inhibit casting, unless special-cased.
"
Cleanse
" does not always refer to the act of removing
all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.
A
cleanse
does not remove
Stasis
, but will remove the disable portion of
Airborne
.
League of Legends content
Cc-Immune
Crowd control immunity
prevents
any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic
monsters
(excluding a summoned
Rift Herald
) and
turrets
are always immune to all crowd control, with the exception of
stasis

Crowd control
A unit that is
disabled
is affected by a status effect that prevents certain actions – such as movement, attacking, casting and/or seeing–blocked, reduced or controlled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
