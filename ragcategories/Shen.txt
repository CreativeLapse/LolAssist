Innate:
Shen
manifests a
Spirit Blade
that he can control with his abilities.

Shen's
ability casts grant him a
shield

his
bonus
health
for a short time. If he affects at least one other
champion
with an ability,
Ki Barrier's
cooldown is
reduced

Innate:
After completing an
ability's

Shen
grants himself a
shield
for
47 − 120 (based on level)
(+ 13%

health)

The
Spirit Blade
spawns with
Shen
, teleports closer to him if he gets too far away, and instantly blinks to him if he uses any global
blink
(
Teleport
,
Recall
, or
Stand United
). It will also dissappear if
Shen
dies and reappear upon
respawning
.
Enemies see an arrow pointing from
Shen
to the location of his
Spirit Blade
even if it is not visible.
Twilight Assault
will grant the shield if the
Spirit Blade
reaches
Shen
. If it is stopped, no shield is granted. It will grant the cooldown reduction upon hitting an enemy champion.
Spirit's Refuge
will grant the shield and/or the cooldown reduction after the protective zone disappears. It does not need to block attacks to trigger the cooldown reduction, just touch an ally champion at any point of the duration.
Shadow Dash
will grant the shield when the dash ends. It will grant the cooldown reduction upon hitting an enemy champion.
If the dash is
interrupted
, the shield will instead be received the moment the
crowd control
source is applied, before damage calculation (if any).
Stand United
will give the shield and/or the cooldown reduction upon completing the channel.

Due to several character stats needing to be recalculated each time a character spawns, casting
Stand United
immediately upon respawning will cause its cooldown to be unaffected by ability haste, and the shielding will not be increased by
Shen's
ability power
, but will be increased by his
bonus

(bug)
Stand United
can target allies via the
mini map
or on their portraits or by using the
F2 - F5
keys (none of this can be done if
Shen
is affected by
nearsight
or his target is
untargetable
).
Shen
will turn to face towards his target ally at the start of the channel.
If the target is
stealthed
, enemies could, in theory, use this to estimate their location.
Shen
will channel so long as his target is alive (even if the granted shield is broken). If his target dies, the channel is canceled and
Stand United
goes on full cooldown.
Interrupting
Stand United's
channel will not remove the shield prematurely.
The target's screen will glow purple to telegraph that
Shen
has targeted them with
Stand United
.
It will change back when the channel ends.
Shen finds the nearest visible enemy champion within 2000 range from the ally or the nearest invisible champion within 600 range to place himself 175 units from his ally towards that enemy.
Stand United
has a
forgiveness radius
of 100 units.

Among the secretive, Ionian warriors known as the Kinkou, Shen serves as their leader, the Eye of Twilight. He longs to remain free from the confusion of emotion, prejudice, and ego, and walks the unseen path of dispassionate judgment between the spirit realm and the physical world. Tasked with enforcing the equilibrium between them, Shen wields blades of steel and arcane energy against any who would threaten it.

Over the millennia, Shen has been called many names: warlord, trespasser, conqueror. Even so, his mission to build an army for the ages seems never-ending. Seeking only the smartest and the strongest to join his ranks, he remains untroubled by emotion, casting his timeless gaze over those with hidden potential.

Perhaps some small part of him recognizes, with each blow to his armor from travelers seeking ancient riches, that his guard is senseless. But life must have meaning. Even life as endless as this.

Trivia
[

]
Shen
is written 慎
shèn
[ʂə̃n˥˩] "caution" in Chinese localization.
Shen was the first champion to use energy as a resource for abilities.
Before the release of
Pulsefire Shen
, neither him nor
Zed
reveal their faces in any of their skins, unlike
Akali
(
All-star
,
Nurse
,
Blood Moon
) and
Kennen
(
Karate
,
M.D.
). However, Shen has never revealed his full face in any skin.
Shen's dance references
Tai chi
24-form
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Shen is the first dark-themed Ionian champion, before
Varus
,
Syndra
,
Zed
,
Jhin
,
Xayah
, &
Kayn
(Noxian-born).
Shen,
Pantheon
, and
Twisted Fate
were the first to have a global-range teleport ability.
After the other two's were heavily changed Shen remained the only one left with such an ability until
Rek'Sai
was released.
Rek'Sai
would then later lose her global-range teleport capabilities as well.
Shen used to gain the
'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength'
cosmetic
Easter egg
debuff (
"This unit is a flippin' ninja!"
-
"Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health."
) when he,
Akali
,
Kennen
, and/or
Zed
found themselves on the same team. It was removed in
V3.14
for unknown reasons.

Warden
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
Wardens
are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.

Top
Within a
drafted team

Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts
,
Divers
,
Battlemages

Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Top Lane
position.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers

Energy
Energy
is a resource designed to limit how much a champion is able to use their
basic
abilities during a set time frame rather than through the use of
mana
. It is represented by a
yellow
bar instead of
blue
.
Energy
has a maximum of
200
(except for
Shen
, with
400
), and regenerates rapidly, at a rate of
10 energy
per second. This means that energy champions are not at risk of depleting their resource over a long period of time, however the small capacity restricts the rapid usage of multiple spells.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash

shields
can trigger bonus effects from

Crowd control
A unit that is
disabled
is affected by a status effect that prevents certain actions – such as movement, attacking, casting and/or seeing–blocked, reduced or controlled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage

Rylai's Crystal Scepter

Liandry's Torment

Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center

It is
less

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0

Effects that

Turret
A
turret
, also called a

Turrets are most notable in
Classic

Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

area damage

,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
