Wukong is a vastayan trickster who uses his strength, agility, and intelligence to confuse his opponents and gain the upper hand. After finding a lifelong friend in the warrior known as Master Yi, Wukong became the last student of the ancient martial art known as Wuju. Armed with an enchanted staff, Wukong seeks to prevent Ionia from falling to ruin.

A greater Infernal whose power is drawn from the molten rock bubbling beneath the earth, Wukong's rage causes mountains to split, lava to rain from the sky, and rivers to become blackened glass. Still, he will never back down from any challenge—and this, perhaps, will be the key to his defeat.

In him, Death saw limitless potential, and chose to claim the disregarded student for the underworld instead. Now, Wukong fights alongside the undying hordes, no longer bound by the rules of the living.

A consummate troublemaker and prankster, Wukong has failed out of every high school in the region, eventually washing out into Labrys as an 'enrollment of last resort'. A naturally gifted fighter in the Battle Club, he still hasn't learned discipline, and only listens to Caitlyn because she can beat him up.

A protector with no one left to protect, Wukong torments any creatures who dare traverse within the Elderwood's depths. After the Coven destroyed his village in search of his enchanted staff's limitless power, he learned that trust is a fool's luxury. The gleam from his weapon's crystals serve as a constant reminder of the ancient trickster's failure.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Wukong is based on
Sun Wukong
from the Chinese novel
Journey to the West
.
Coincidentally, much of
Garen's
kit was a possible basis for Wukong, mainly due to both characters having:
A "Q" ability that originally stated its scaling to be over 100% in attack damage as an auto-attack booster and reset with an extra effect (
Decisive Strike
silences with a movement speed boost while
Wukong's
Crushing Blow
reduces armor by a percentage), and applies on-hit effects as well.
A passive ability that increases their defensive stats (with Garen's being a normal ability with not only percentage defensive boosts, but also with a damage reduction active while Wukong's only being a standard passive with flat defense/HP boosts).
Point-and-click spells; Garen's can only target one champion with it and acts as his ultimate; Wukong's can hit two extra targets in range, moves him to said target(s) and acts as a normal ability. Both versions at some point have interacted with magic damage (
Garen's
Demacian Justice
originally inflicted bonus magic damage while
Wukong's
Nimbus Strike
now scales with magic damage and ability power as of his gameplay update).
Cyclone
and
Judgment
involve a very similar spinning animation and near-identical mechanics in the way their hits are racked up, how they provide bonus movement speed during cast time, and cancellation. A number of certain item actives and summoner spells can even be used during their cast times, though depending on the champion there are exclusive item actives only available to them during such abilities, as Wukong before his update could not activate
Tiamat's
/
Ravenous Hydra's
active during
Cyclone
.
Cyclone
also cannot critically strike, unlike
Judgment
.
Likewise, both their ultimates (
Demacian Justice
and
Cyclone
) have HP-based-damage-scaling against their targets.
The name of
Cyclone
on the Chinese Servers, 大鬧天宮 (
trad.
) 大闹天宫 (
simpl.
) (
Dànào Tiāngōng
, lit.
Greatly Wrecking the Heavenly Palace
) references the Monkey King's rebellion against the Jade Emperor & other heavenly government's officials, until Buddha sealed him the Five Finger Mountain (
Wǔzhǐshān
, 五指山) for five centuries, before embarking on his westward journey to redeem himself.
[2]
Other
MOBA's
than
League of Legends
(such as
Heroes of Newerth
[3]
,
Smite
[4]
, and
Dota 2
[5]
) also feature a character based on Sun Wukong. These expies of the Monkey King (including
Smite's
pre-worked Sun Wukong
) have similar abilities and playstyles (mainly being damaging tanks with assassin potential, and having very unique tricks with their abilities).
Wukong is one of a few champions to have multiple textures in one skin. When he uses
Warrior Trickster
, his clone will be of a different colour palette which can only be seen by Wukong and his allies. To the opposing team, the two Wukongs look exactly the same, including copies of any external
buffs
and
item
effects active at the moment the clone is spawned (Prior to patch
V5.22
, clones did not duplicate external buff/active item effect particles).
Four other champions with this feature are
LeBlanc
(via
Mirror Image
),
Shaco's
(via
Hallucinate
),
Nasus
(via
Fury of the Sands
) and
Malphite
(via
Granite Shield
and
Thunderclap
).
Wukong's
critical strike
animation is a possible nod to a famous pole-vaulting kick used by many incarnations of the original Sun Wukong, especially in the TV drama adaptations of
Journey to the West
, and his
Warriors Orochi / Musou Orochi
incarnation as well.
When a Wukong Bot uses
Warrior Trickster
, the decoy is named "MonkeyKing Bot".
Wukong is the only champion with two
Lunar Revel
skins.
Before his gameplay update,
Cyclone
was originally tied as one of the highest AD ratio abilities in the game.

Diver
Fighters
are durable and damage-focused melee champions that look to be in the thick of combat.
Divers
are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. Divers are not as durable as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP

champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

abilities

items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's

Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are

League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings

League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the

Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch

knock them up
once.
Cyclone
can be recast within the duration, and does so automatically afterwards.
Recast:

Cyclone
. He cast
Cyclone
a second time within a period after the first cast has ended.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Pet damage
Pet damage
is the damage type dealt primarily by the basic attacks of
champion summoned units
, although the majority of damage sourced from pets is otherwise classified (e.g.
spell damage
,
area damage
, or
persistent damage
).
Pet damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. Some examples that are triggered include:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
will trigger whenever you deal an instance of
pet damage
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) and
omnivamp
heals for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Stasis
A unit that is in
stasis
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use
any
summoner spell
for the duration, while also being
invulnerable
and
untargetable
.
Stasis
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), all
channeled and charged
abilities and all
dashes
and
displacements
. Units that are being
knocked up
will be placed on the ground, but aren't
knocked down
(the
airborne
status is not removed in this case).
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Epic monsters
and
turrets
are special cased to be affected by
stasis
despite them being
crowd control immune
.
Removal:
Cannot be removed by any means (except through
death
), and will prevent the activation of abilities that would usually remove
crowd control
effects.
Quicksilver
will either be placed on a short cooldown, remain usable, or become disabled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
League of Legends content
Auto-targeted
Auto-targeted
is a targeting paradigm that is autonomous; the source
is not required
to acquire a target, rather the ability or spell upon activation applies its effects by itself selectively. This type of targeting usually needs a sufficient target within range to be castable.
League of Legends content
Celestial Blessing
COOLDOWN:
15
Active:
Kayle
heals
herself and an allied champion. Additionally, both of them gains
move speed
for a brief time.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Magic damage

Ghosted
A unit that is
ghosted
ignores
unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life
,
Cleanse
,
Mikael's Blessing
, and
Quicksilver
, remove the
airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
League of Legends content
Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
