Sejuani is the brutal, unforgiving Iceborn warmother of the Winter’s Claw, one of the most feared tribes of the Freljord. Her people’s survival is a constant, desperate battle against the elements, forcing them to raid Noxians, Demacians, and Avarosans alike to survive the harsh winters. Sejuani herself spearheads the most dangerous of these attacks from the saddle of her drüvask boar Bristle, using her True Ice flail to freeze and shatter her enemies.

A beast tamer as well as hunter, Sejuani rides her trusty mount Bristle into the thick of combat before snaring massive creatures in the chain of her flail. An almost supernaturally strong woman, she can—temporarily—hold down beasts weighing several tons, which is exactly the window her fellow hunters need.

Trivia
[

]
Her name resembles that of Roman
equestrian
Sejanus
'; from theonym
Seia
, Roman goddess of sown seeds,
[2]
from Proto-Indo-European
*seh₁-
.
[3]
Her direct ancestor
Serylda's
name comes from two Germanic roots:
*sarwo
"armor, equipment" and
*hildiz
"fight, battle".
Bristle
might be
inspired
by the boar
Gullinbursti
from
Norse mythology
.
She is referenced in
Assassin's Creed Valhalla
.
[4]
Sejuani is currently the champion with the shortest time between their initial release and a full visual game play update, at 1 year and 3 months.
Sejuani, the Winter's Wrath
Sejuani was the first
champion
released in
2012
.
In Sejuani's
Art Spotlight
, the artist names the layer that has the boar on it "Piggles". A screenshot can be seen
here.
If
Ashe
,
Lissandra
, and/or Sejuani are played on opposing teams,
Battle for Freljord
will trigger. This in-game quest consists in one killing the other to earn the title of 'Queen of Freljord' (complete with a floating ice crown floating above their heads) referencing the civil war taking place there, between the three tribes each lead.
Sejuani, Fury of the North
Sejuani,
Corki
,
Kled
,
Nunu
,
Rell
, and
Rumble
are the only mounted champions.
Sejuani,
Karma
,
Lee Sin
, and
Trundle
are the only champions to feature a 'traditional' skin representing them before their visual updates (hers was conceived after
an unreleased 'Queen' skin
).
Bristle's
animations were recycled for the
Tuskbeard
monster from
Odyssey: Extraction
, a
rotating game mode
.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.

on instances of
Physical damage
and

Slow
A unit that is

movement speed

Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
League of Legends content
Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport
,
Hexflash
, and
Mark
/
Dash
.
Airborne
is an
immobilizing
effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts
attack windups
(excluding
uncancellable windups
), and all
channeled and charged
abilities. The accompanying
displacement
overrides all other previous
displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne
and its
forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, and
Dr. Mundo's
Goes Where He Pleases
.
Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside
airborne
effects cannot be removed by cleanses, which innately disables attacking and moving and can be overridden by
dashing
or
blinking
.
Cleansing
effects, with the exceptions of
Milio's
Breath of Life

airborne
status effect.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed

debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.

Knockdown
Knockdown
only affects units that are performing a
dash
or being displaced by an
airborne
effect. A unit that is
knocked down
has its
dash
or
displacement
interrupted and is placed on the ground instantly.
Knockdown
is not a
status effect
.
Interrupts:
Interrupts all

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

Fury of the North
Innate - Icebreaker:
Enemies
stunned

their
maximum
health

Innate - Frost Armor:
Sejuani
gains
Frost Armor
, which lingers shortly after taking damage from enemy
champions
or large
monsters
. She restores it after a period without taking damage from them.
Frost Armor:
Sejuani gains
bonus
armor

Glacial Prison
COOLDOWN:
130 / 110 / 90
Active:
Sejuani
throws an ice bola in the target direction that stops upon hitting an enemy champion, dealing
magic damage
and briefly
stunning
them.
If the bola travels far enough, it becomes empowered to detonate upon reaching max range or hitting an enemy champion, gaining increased damage and stun duration. It also creates a frost storm that
slows
enemies within.
After a brief moment, the storm shatters to deal
magic damage
and briefly
slow
enemies within.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
