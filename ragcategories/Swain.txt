This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.
The total damage to a single target will be split evenly among each bolt that hits, meaning that hitting with more bolts will deal less damage per hit (but more overall damage).

Nevermove's
missiles have their speed update to accelerate at specific times by the server. The client applies these speed increases after additional specified delays, while the hitbox behaviour itself only uses the timings noted above.
Nevermove's
recast can be used during the cast time of other spells.
Spell shields
block either the pass-through or the detonation, not both.
If the root is not applied to or is removed from all champions, the recast does not become available.
The pull will interrupt
channels
at the very beginning, but does not keep the target stunned for the rest of the movement.
Channels
can be started successfully during the pull, provided the previous crowd control does not prevent them still.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the start of the cast time.
if the target champion is rooted by Nevermove but becomes spell-immune before the pull, Swain will not receive a soul fragment on reactivation since the champion cannot be displaced.

Jericho Swain is the visionary ruler of Noxus, an expansionist nation that reveres only strength. Though he was cast down and crippled in the Ionian wars, his left arm severed, he seized control of the empire with ruthless determination.. and a new, demonic hand. Now, Swain commands from the front lines, marching against a coming darkness that only he can see—in glimpses gathered by shadowy ravens from the corpses all around him. In a swirl of sacrifice and secrets, the greatest secret of all is that the true enemy lies within.

The hextech artificer known as Jericho Swain is an almost legendary figure among Piltover's growing upper crust. Though he professes not to meddle in city affairs, he has been quietly integrating various hextech components into his own body… and with them, unparalleled access to the eyes and ears of thousands of artificial creatures.

The Hunter Swain made no acknowledgment of his fellow leaders and was the first to put himself forward. He desired the Aurora's blessings to better provide meat and pelts for his people. After making his case, he gave the smallest of bows to Polaris, who watched with a face as serene as moonlit ice. Satisfied, Swain stepped aside and waited for his gift.

(depending on the skin it could also be Snow Owls, Macaws, Demon birds, or Dragons) can be seen around the map.
His mannerisms, quotes and the "Grand General" persona are reminiscent of
Tywin Lannister
from
Game of Thrones
.
At the start of the game, there is a chance of thematic music with ravens in the background.
His
demonic left arm
could be a reference to
Murtaugh
in the
Submachine series
. After losing his left arm, Murtaugh discovered he had a third "karma" arm, which was extremely powerful and capable of causing mass destruction. Murtaugh pursues his goals with similar ruthlessness as Swain.
The
sigil
that appears beneath Swain when his ultimate ability is cast has three runes and three eyes inscribed into it. This is possibly a reference to the
Three-eyed Raven
from the book series
A Song of Ice and Fire
, considering both characters possess the ability to see events occurring around the world through magical means.
The sigil used in
Original Swain
,
Northern Front Swain
,
Bilgewater Swain
, and
Tyrant Swain
is an edited version of the sigil that appears when
Gatekeeper Galio
uses his
ultimate ability
.
[2]
Dragon Master Swain
uses the unedited of the sigil.
The head of
Raum, Swain's demon, shortly appears above Swain when he uses his ultimate ability.
Swain, the Master Tactician
The name Swain is derived from the Old Norse
sveinn
for "boy".
Swain's raven is named Beatrice.
[3]
Beatrice can be seen on the
Crystal Scar
. She will land on the barrier near the Boneyard node for a short time and then fly off.
Swain's
Ravenous Flock
transformation has a similar appearance to Tzeentch's daemon servants, the
Lords of Change
, from the Warhammer franchise.
The icon for
Ravenous Flock
is similar to the old one for
Tides of Blood
.
The
Art Spotlight
for
his
first splash art is the first one ever released.
If Swain dies while casting
Decrepify
, there will be two Beatrices on the battlefield, one attached to the laser and one on his back when he falls to the ground.
The ending quote to Swain's background is based on Joseph Heller's novel
Catch-22
.
In
the League of Legends
, Swain was unable to compete in the
Ionia Versus Noxus Grudge Match
due to his recent induction into Noxian High Command, thus needing to take time away from the League to put all his affairs in order.
In the
2014
version of the
Ultra Rapid Fire
featured game mode
,
Ravenous Flock
would toggle-off once its mana cost scaled beyond Swain's maximum mana. This was the only ability affected by the restriction of a champion requiring sufficient maximum mana in order to activate an ability within the game mode.

Battlemage
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Battlemages
(also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down their opponents over time, Battle Mages have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for a short period of time.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP

champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

abilities

items

runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana

Current

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.

Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.

Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are

.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed

Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below

movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.

A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.

A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
