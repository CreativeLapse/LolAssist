:
16 / 12 / 8 / 4 (based on level)
SPEED:
2000
/
5000
Innate:
Akshan's
basic attack causes him to fire a second attack that deals
reduced
physical damage
. If
Akshan
cancels the second attack, he gains a brief burst of
move speed
.
Innate:
Akshan's
attacks and abilities apply a stack to enemies hit. The third stack consumes them all to deal
bonus
magic damage
; if the target was a
champion
, he also gains a brief
shield
.
Innate:
Whenever
Akshan
uses a
basic attack
, he fires an additional shot after a delay that deals
50% AD
physical damage
, increased to
100% AD
against
minions
. Issuing an
attack order
on a different target before the additional shot has been launched causes
Akshan
to fire it at the new target. If the second shot is cancelled instead, he gains
20 − 75 (based on level)
×
(1 + 100%
bonus
attack speed)
bonus
movement speed
decaying over 1 second.
The additional shot applies

Innate:
Akshan's
basic attacks
on-hit
and
ability
hits apply a
stack
of
Dirty Fighting
to enemies for 5 seconds, refreshing on subsequent applications and stacking up to 3 times. The third stack against a target consumes them all to deal them
15 / 40 / 80 / 150 (based on level)
(+ 60% AP)
bonus
magic damage
; if the target is a
champion
,
Akshan
will also gain a

shield
for 2 seconds. The shield may be gained only once every few seconds.

Applies
basic damage
for the second shot and
proc damage
for the bonus damage.
The second shot:
Is treated as a basic attack.
Critically strikes
independently from the first shot.
Can be cancelled by inputting a different command right after using the first shot.
Counts as a separate hit for effects such as
Electrocute
,
Muramana's
Shock
, and
Eclipse's
Ever Rising Moon
.
Starts the attack windup's cooldown after it is used, rather than when the first shot is.
The attack speed scaling on the movement speed buff includes the bonus attack speed gained from
Akshan's
innate attack speed growth.
At level 18, at minimum it grants 126 decaying movement speed.
Changing targets for the second shot will also
acquire
the new target.
The second shot, if the first shot's target was killed, will prioritize
visible
enemy champions, then
minions

low health

The second cast's dash will displace
Akshan
around the terrain in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, with the specific direction being determined by the position of the player's cursor relative to his facing direction.
The dash will move clockwise if the player's cursor is anywhere to the left of
Akshan
from his facing direction (or perspective), and counterclockwise if the cursor is anywhere to his right.
Akshan
will not stop swinging until his dash is stopped.
The swing will end prematurely if the terrain the hook was attached to no longer exists, such as
player-generated terrain
.
Akshan
will prioritize firing at enemies he damaged with
any
unit-targeted ability or spell within the last 4 seconds, such as
Comeuppance
or
Ignite
.
Heroic Swing
grants a buff to
Akshan
for 2 seconds that indicates and determines the first cast's duration.
This buff starts as soon as the ability is cast, and lingers for 0.
125
seconds after it expires.
This means the hook can be attached to terrain for longer if it hits it earlier in the duration, and vice versa.
If
Akshan
dashes
(excluding second cast's dash) or
blinks
or becomes affected by
immobilization
,
ground
, or
polymorph
in the duration, the buff is removed
immediately
, causing the first cast to be lost and cancelling
Heroic Swing
entirely.
Akshan
immediately fires one shot at the beginning of his swing and a final shot while dismounting from the swing.
Akshan
can fire at any targetable enemy unit excluding
structures
and
jungle plants
.
Only
Heroic Swing's
first cast is disabled while
grounded
or
rooted
. The third cast is still usable during those effects.
Heroic Swing's
second and third cast can both be used while
silenced
.
Takedowns
against
clones
do not count for resetting
Heroic Swing's
cooldown.
If a
takedown
is scored while
Heroic Swing
is active, the cooldown afterwards will be 0.
5
seconds.
Akshan
will attempt to basic attack the target he fired at with the last shot after the third cast's dash ends, if there is no other input given.
Each shot generates a stack of
Conqueror
.
Spell shield
will only block a single shot.
The attack speed scaling on the damage of the attacks includes the bonus attack speed gained from
Akshan's
innate attack speed growth.
At level 18, each shot at minimum deals 108.
36
(+ 18.

physical damage.
Despite this ability not applying
on-attack
effects, it does apply
Navori Flickerblade's
Transcendence
.
(bug)
Under certain circumstances, upon attaching the hook to terrain,
Akshan
will create a particle on the location permanently.
(bug)
This particle can be attacked by minions.

A kill threshold will appear on the
health bar
of the target locked onto during the channel, which increases each time
Akshan

The indicator factors the bonus damage applied by

It also factors the projected increase in the target's

It updates dynamically over the channel's duration, reacting to fluctuations of the target's health and damage mitigations.

Raising an eyebrow in the face of danger, Akshan fights evil with dashing charisma, righteous vengeance, and a conspicuous lack of shirts. He is highly skilled in the art of stealth combat, able to evade the eyes of his enemies and reappear when they least expect him. With a keen sense of justice and a legendary death-reversing weapon, he rights the wrongs of Runeterra's many scoundrels while living by his own moral code: “Don't be an ass.”

The Neon Rogue of Sound City has become the hero of the underground, largely due to his bravery, his wit, and his uncanny ability to sneak into highly-secure corporate buildings without being detected. Being charming as hell doesn't hurt, either.

As roguish as he is handsome, Akshan abandons his daring adventures each year to make a highly-requested appearance at the festival. He might be seen stealing a dance or two, but he only has eyes for one among the crowd. Their moral… discrepancies are no match for the electrifying chemistry between them.

When the Order of Solace found Akshan, he was a soulless weapon of death caught in a cycle of revenge following his mentor's murder. Even with his despair, the Order's teachings were able to fill the endless hole within Akshan and rejuvenate him. Now he stands with Malzahar as a Three Honors stalwart, ready to fight the Essents with harmony and quips.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:
Demolisher
Scrapper
Examples
Ashe
Ezreal
Lucian
Kai'Sa
Jhin
League of Legends content
Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration

abilities

items
,

, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current

Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.

Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range

Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or

Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects

ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage

On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.

critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Minion
Minions
are autonomous units that spawn periodically from their nexus and advance along the lanes toward the enemy nexus. They
basic attack
any enemy unit or structure they find in their way, but can be killed for
gold
.
There are four kind of
minions
:
melee minions
,
caster minions
,
siege minions
and
super minions
.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Standard sight
Standard sight
reveals units through
fog of war
and
brush
, but
not
stealth
. It does not bypass
nearsight
effects.
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet
,
Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.

Camouflage
Camouflage
is a form of stealth that renders a unit hidden from enemy
vision
for a
long
period of time. It is usually activated preemptively in order to ambush an enemy or to bypass the surveillance of hostile
wards
patrolling an area. It also grants
ghosting
.
Camouflaged
units are revealed while being inside the line of sight (e.g. not in the fog of war, behind terrain, or blocked by
nearsight
) of a nearby enemy
champion
(with the range depending on the ability), when within the vision radius of an enemy
Control Ward
(900 units), or from sources of
True Sight
.
Stealthed
units shimmer their character model for 0.
6
seconds whenever they take damage.
A unit will shimmer for every instance of damage they take, and shimmering does not make the unit targetable nor remove the
stealth
effect, but grants positional information to the enemy.
When a
camouflaged
unit can be seen, they will be warned by an exclamation mark above them indicating they have been spotted.

Clone
A
clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet
that attempts to imitate a
champion
, copying their current vitality, stats, items, level, and most status effects upon creation. They are considered champions against many effects that do not strictly require
player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.
The
damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a
clone

Zombie state
A buff that allows a player to keep controlling their
champion
after
Death
always flags the champion to be in a
zombie state
. It prevents enemies from gaining full kill credit or triggering most on-kill effects from the champion a second time, and some abilities (e.g.
You and Me!
) interact differently with champions in this state.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout

Resurrection

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).
