The extra distance that the bolts travel scales with

attack range.
Spray and Pray
allows
Twitch
to outrange
turrets
by 50 units, allowing him to hit them without them returning fire.
Twitch
targets his line attack at his target's location at the
start
of his attack windup.
The
bolts
reach targets at a delay, composed of
Twitch's
windup time and distance the
bolt
has to travel at finite speed. Even the primary target can dodge the attack if they are moving quickly enough.
The
bolt
projectiles will naturally pass through terrain and enemy structures (the latter will be damaged by
bolts
even if they are not directly targeted).
If
Twitch
is
blinded
before winding up the attack, the hits will
miss
against
all
targets.
Runaan's Hurricane's
Wind's Fury
interacts with
Spray and Pray's
bonus
attack range
but not with the modified missile effect (the secondary bolts will not have pass-through effects).
Whenever the
bolts
penetrate a target, a small elongated cloud appears at the location, which's VFX and SFX
can
be seen and heard inside the Fog of War.
The
bolts'
travel distance scales with the full value of
Twitch's
attack range
increases such as
Rapid Firecannon
, but not with size increases (which only increase his effective attack range, thereby the target range).
(Outdated as of
V10.13
, now can hit everything with edge range, except for turrets) The
center of a unit must be within the maximum travel distance of the
bolt
missile, and in front of the spawn location (
Twitch's
center) for the
bolt
to be able to hit them.
Other than this condition, the
bolt
missile has to only touch (pass within its half width of 60 units) the
edge of the unit's radius.
This is standard behaviour for
linear skillshots
.
Tips & Tricks
Runaan's Hurricane's
bolts can target the same units that are hit by
Twitch's
penetrated
bolt
, increasing the total damage dealt to them and applying
on-hit
effects twice.

A Zaunite plague rat by birth, but a connoisseur of filth by passion, Twitch is not afraid to get his paws dirty. Aiming a chem-powered crossbow at the gilded heart of Piltover, he has vowed to show those in the city above just how filthy they really are. Always a sneaky sneak, when he’s not rooting around in the Sump, he’s digging deep into other people’s garbage for discarded treasures… and perhaps a moldy sandwich.

Many in Bilgewater get called a filthy rat, but none deserve the title more than the Kingpin himself. While other crime bosses in the port city may loathe to get their hands dirty, Twitch revels in wading into the filth himself—crossbow in hand, and a finely aged egg in his pocket.

Marksman
Marksmen
(formerly "Carries") excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger. Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases to become true damage threats.
At present, Marksmen do not have any official subclasses. The following have been considered:

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Bottom Carry
position.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to

miss
their
basic attacks

Camouflage
Camouflage
is a form of stealth that renders a unit hidden from enemy
vision
for a
long
period of time. It is usually activated preemptively in order to ambush an enemy or to bypass the surveillance of hostile
wards
patrolling an area. It also grants
ghosting
.
Camouflaged
units are revealed while being inside the line of sight (e.g. not in the fog of war, behind terrain, or blocked by
nearsight
) of a nearby enemy
champion
(with the range depending on the ability), when within the vision radius of an enemy
Control Ward
(900 units), or from sources of
True Sight
.
Stealthed
units shimmer their character model for 0.
6
seconds whenever they take damage.
A unit will shimmer for every instance of damage they take, and shimmering does not make the unit targetable nor remove the
stealth
effect, but grants positional information to the enemy.
When a
camouflaged
unit can be seen, they will be warned by an exclamation mark above them indicating they have been spotted.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control

interrupt
all
channels

Stasis
A unit that is in
stasis
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use
any
summoner spell
for the duration, while also being
invulnerable
and
untargetable

Removal:
Cannot be removed by any means (except through

crowd control
effects.
Quicksilver
will either be placed on a short cooldown, remain usable, or become disabled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
