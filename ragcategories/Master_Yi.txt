Double Strike
Innate:
Master Yi's
basic attacks generate a stack of
Double Strike
for a few seconds. At 3 stacks, his next basic attack will consume them to make a second attack that deals
reduced
physical damage
.
Innate:
Master Yi's
basic attacks
on-hit
generate a
stack
of
Double Strike
for 4 seconds, refreshing on subsequent hits and stacking up to 3 times. At 3 stacks,
Master Yi's
next basic attack
on-attack
is empowered to consume the stacks
on-hit
and strike twice, the second strike dealing
50% AD
physical damage
.
The second strike applies
on-hit
and
on-attack
effects at 100% effectiveness and is affected by
critical strike
modifiers.
If
Master Yi's
primary target is killed before the second strike, he automatically attacks another enemy within 300 range.
The second strike can
critically strike
against
structures

Since
Double Strike
resets the counter with the first strike, and the second strike applies on-hit effects, the second strike is able to add a stack for the next
Double Strike
activation.
If
Double Strike's
target becomes
untargetable
shortly after the triggering attack, it will still occur and deal its effects as usual.
Basic attacks that are
dodged
,
blocked
, or missed while
Master Yi
is
blinded
will not generate any stacks of
Double Strike
nor refresh the duration of active stacks.
Double Strike's
interaction with parry effects at 3 stacks (the damage of the strikes is negated in all cases):
If the triggering basic attack is
dodged
,
Master Yi
will not perform the second strike nor consume the stacks.
If the triggering basic attack is
blocked
,
Master Yi
will perform the second strike but not consume the stacks.
If the triggering basic attack misses while
Master Yi
is
blinded
, he will consume the stacks.
The second strike will fail to hit the target at all if the triggering attack misses.
On-attack
effects do not occur, despite the attack animation playing.

Active:
Master Yi
briefly

and marks the target enemy, then rapidly marks up to 3 other nearby enemies. If there are no other eligible targets before then,
Master Yi
can mark the same enemies again. Upon finishing marking, he
reappears
and detonates the marks, dealing
physical damage
and applying
on-hit
effects. Subsequent marks on a target have less effect. Basic attacks
reduce
Alpha Strike's
cooldown.
Active:
Master Yi
vanishes
and becomes
unable to act
. After
0.

If there are no other un-marked targets before then,

Master Yi
can select a direction from the primary target.

will reappear at the initial cast location instead.
Master Yi
then detonates the marks, dealing
physical damage
and applying
on-hit

Alpha Strike's

reappears.
Alpha Strike's
cooldown reduction

When
Master Yi
bounces from a unit it will grant
vision
in a 600 radius around it for up-to
0.
627
seconds
after
Alpha Strike
ends, including across terrain, though not into
brushes
.
It will always grant vision around the primary target, even if he doesn't bounce off it.
Alpha Strike's
damage is calculated at the moment that each mark is placed. Because of this, it is possible to inflict differing amounts of damage if
Master Yi's
AD
changes between marks.
Master Yi
will follow all his primary target's movements.
Alpha Strike
can only follow up-to
2000
units; If the target teleports a very long distance, it will not be followed.
While vanished, the initial cast location of
Alpha Strike
counts as
Master Yi's
position, which is considered for effects such as
tethers
.
If the primary target becomes
untargetable
and there are no other nearby valid targets,
Alpha Strike
will end prematurely and will not deal the damage occurring after
Master Yi's
reappearance.
The choice of exit direction occurs through an indicator anchored to the target during the time that
Master Yi
is vanished. You are unable to choose the exit direction after the third mark.
(bug)
Selection commands (default: MB1/left click) and movement commands (default: MB2/right click) are both valid.
Multiple commands can be issued, but only the
final
command before exiting will determine the direction.
If the primary target is a champion,
Master Yi
will be automatically ordered to basic attack them after
Alpha Strike
ends.
Master Yi
will not be able to buffer other abilities.
(bug)
Only the first instance of damage counts as a hit for effects such as
Conqueror
,
Electrocute
and
Eclipse's
Ever Rising Moon
.
Alpha Strike
does not interact with
Press the Attack
or
Kraken Slayer's

Spell shield
will only block a single instance of damage.
On-hit damage applied by
Alpha Strike
will be negated by
dodge
and
block
, but not while
Master Yi
is
blinded
.
Alpha Strike's
own damage will not be negated.
If
Master Yi
dies
during
Alpha Strike
and he is only focusing one target, the ability will only deal the reduced damage strikes and not the final tick of damage from reappearing.
If he is striking multiple targets the damage will be dealt immediately when
dying
, and if he
dies
before the bounce from the last target,
Alpha Strike
will deal reduced damage only to all units he already bounced from.
(bug)
If
Master Yi
enters
resurrection
during
Alpha Strike
and he is only focusing one target, the ability will deal the reduced damage strikes as normal and the final tick of damage after being
resurrected
.
If he is striking multiple targets,
Alpha Strike
will
sometimes
deal the reduced damage from repeated bounces and the main damage after being
resurrected
, and
sometimes
only the reduced damage, unrelated to the number of targets available.

Master Yi has tempered his body and sharpened his mind, so that thought and action have become almost as one. Though he chooses to enter into violence only as a last resort, the grace and speed of his blade ensures resolution is always swift. As one of the last living practitioners of the Ionian art of Wuju, Yi has devoted his life to continuing the legacy of his people—scrutinizing potential new disciples with the Seven Lenses of Insight to identify the most worthy among them.

Master Yi's family refused Cabal control, fleeing Rabadon City—only to be snuffed out. To fight back, he became one of the first Inkshadow Warriors, sacrificing his lifespan for a magical tattoo that grants him the power to raise his sword against the Cabal. He doesn't know how long he has left to live; still, he will save his city… and get his revenge.

A prince requires a master of the highest caliber to teach him martial arts, and there is no dragon of greater skill than Master Yi. A true master must be both warrior and poet, champion and artist—and in the spirit of learning, must always be ready for anything.

Trivia

]
Master Yi's name is a play on the word "mastery".
Master Yi's goggles and his
sword
can both be seen in the game's Mac Version trailer.
Master Yi is the champion with the highest base
movement speed
in-game (355).
Master Yi's
Recall
animation references
Junpei Iori's
victory pose
in
Persona 4 Arena Ultimax
videogame.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
Master Yi's dance references the
"Running Man" dance
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here,
which references the
version
done by the character
Dee Dee
from the
Dexter's Laboratory
cartoons, specifically from the episode
'Sister's Got a Brand New Bag'
.
The more total movement speed he has,
the faster
he dances.
Inversely, the less total movement speed he has,
the slower
he dances.
His pre-
rework
dance references
Napoleon Dynamite
, via
one of its portions
.
He shared this dance with
Katarina
, whose dance references the other portions.
Master Yi's title in the Chinese localization also dubs him as a "Sword Sage", a title given to most master swordmen in history such as Miyamoto Musashi.
In the Chinese localization, it is instead named as "Wuji" (無極, lit. Extremeless/Apolar/Infinite). Wuji is also represented by an empty circle atop the
Taijitu
(太極圖 lit. Great Poles' Chart), which includes the well-known
Yin and Yang
. His
Wuju Style
ability in Chinese is also dubbed as "Wuji Jiandao" (無極劍道, lit. Extremeless Sword Path), "jiandao" is also the pinyin reading of Japanese
kendou
.
Highlander
was named after as well as references
the eponymous franchise
, with its cooldown reset mechanic possibly referencing the "quickening" effect.
A functional real-life replica of Master Yi's
'Highlander' Ring Sword
was crafted in an episode of YouTube series
Man At Arms: Reforged

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Jungler
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.
League of Legends content
Critical strike
Critical strike
refers to an effect that deals increased damage under specific circumstances, denoted as
critical strike damage
. The most common form of critical strike occurs on
basic attacks
, which triggers based on
critical strike chance
.
By default, a critical strike deals 175% of the normal damage. Critical damage modifiers such as
Infinity Edge
can increase this percentage.
League of Legends content
Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.
League of Legends content
Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage
have the
physical damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal
,
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of
basic damage
dealt.
Basic damage
is negated by
dodge
and
block
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
League of Legends content
Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike
and
Nilah's
Jubilant Veil
.
League of Legends content
Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind

dodge
take precedence over
block
.
Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge
.
League of Legends content
Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Vanish
In addition to granting
untargetability
,
vanish
briefly hides a unit from the game's renderer, which causes it to become completely undetectable and invisible even to effects such as
Oracle Lens
.
Vanished
units are
unable to act
. As with all untargetability,
tethers
will still persist on a target that
vanishes
.
Vanish
is not considered
stealth
and does not interact with
sight
effects.

Blink
A

refers to a form of movement whereby a unit displaces from point A to B without traversing the space between.
League of Legends content
Lockout
A champion that is
locked out
is unable to perform certain actions such as casting abilities, moving, or attacking. The prevented actions can vary per instance.
Lockout does not interact with

League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Brush
Brush
is a common terrain feature that obstructs
sight
for any unit outside of it.
League of Legends content
Tether
A
tether
is an effect that applies a
bind
buff on both the source and the target(s), which then creates the actual tether that requires both to remain in close proximity so any accompanying effects (
damage
,
crowd control
,
heals
,
buffs
, etc) can apply.
The tether breaks if it exceeds maximum range, or either conduit is removed (e.g.
Death
). The tether will also break from a transition into the
zombie state
due to the target already dying.
Generally, a
bind
with an enemy will break along with the tether, whereas a bind with an ally will last indefinitely and automatically reapply the tether when within range.
League of Legends content
Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet
,
Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.
Resurrection
effects do not count for kills or assists.
Resurrection
sources have a hierarchy, and will trigger in the following order:
Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth
and
Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection
will always take precedence over
zombie state
effects. Entering
resurrection
does not cancel cast times.
Renata Glasc's
Bailout
always takes priority over
resurrection
.
