The Relentless Storm
EFFECT RADIUS:
450
Innate:
Volibear's
basic attacks and ability hits generate a stack of
The Relentless Storm
, which stacks up to 5 times. At 5 stacks, he gains Lightning Claws.
The Relentless Storm:
For each stack,
Volibear
gains
bonus
attack speed
.
Lightning Claws:
Volibear's
basic attacks deal
bonus
magic damage
that can chain to up to four surrounding enemies.
Innate:
Whenever
Volibear
damages at least one enemy with a
basic attack
or
ability
, he generates a
stack
of
The Relentless Storm
for 6 seconds, refreshing on subsequent damage and stacking up to 5 times. At 5 stacks,
Volibear
gains
Lightning Claws
.
The Relentless Storm:
For each stack,
Volibear
gains
5%
(+ 4% per 100 AP)
bonus
attack speed
, up to
25%
(+ 20% per 100 AP)
.
Lightning Claws:
Volibear's
claws ignite with lightning, empowering his basic attacks
on-hit
to deal
11 − 60 (based on level)
(+ 50% AP)
bonus
magic damage
to the target and the nearest
visible
enemy within 450 units of the target, chaining up to 4 subsequent targets.

Volibear's
spikes visually grow as
The Relentless Storm
stacks.
Stacks of
The Relentless Storm
are also granted
on-hit
, but will specifically not be if the target is
invulnerable
.
While at four stacks, the next attack or ability on-hit reaching the fifth stack will be empowered by
Lightning Claws
.
A stack of
The Relentless Storm
is not gained if the attack is
dodged
and/or missed if
Volibear
is
blinded
. A stack is granted even if the attack is
blocked
. In all cases,
Lightning Claws
will not apply (on-hit damage is parried and the bounce is prevented).
Since
Frenzied Maul
cannot be missed while
Volibear
is
blinded
, gaining stacks from
The Relentless Storm
and applying
Lighting Claws
from the ability will not be prevented from that parry effect.
Volibear
has a hidden passive that grants him
1 armor
for every enemy
Zilean
within 800 range of him.
Likewise,
Zilean
gains
1 ability power
for every nearby
Volibear
.
Neither
Volibear
nor
Zilean
need
sight
of one another to gain these bonuses.
The empowered attacks do not affect
structures
nor
wards

The windup for the attack completes even if the target becomes

Thundering Smash's

Thundering Smash's
attack does not put
Volibear's
basic attack on cooldown.

Shield of Daybreak
, effectively being a double attack reset.
If Thundering Smash's buff appears as the first on the buff bar, the empowered attack will fail against

To those who still revere him, the Volibear is the storm made manifest. Destructive, wild, and stubbornly resolute, he existed before mortals walked the Freljord’s tundra, and is fiercely protective of the lands that he and his demi-god kin created. Cultivating a deep hatred of civilization and the weakness it brought with it, he now fights to return to the old ways—when the land was untamed, and blood spilled freely—and eagerly battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination.

In an age before man, King Voli ruled the bitter northlands, and he was as harsh and unforgiving as they were. It is said that he waged a terrible war against his brother, the great King Ornn, and that their struggle razed mountains and emptied seas, as the two of them became like beasts themselves.

For his utter incompetence in the field, it was made certain he would remain on desk duty for the rest of his career. Even so, he and Constable Trundle always end up patrolling the streets with mountains of paperwork left in their wake.

Volibear was the greatest terror in the forest, until the nearby volcano erupted. In the frenzy of escape, Volibear came across a child who was similarly trapped, and heeded a strange instinct—he saved the child. The Duality Dragon saw and made the mighty predator an offer: the power to hone the duality of his nature, both fury and compassion.

A spirit of fury and war, many vengeful souls have made contracts with the Volibear, and only Udyr has survived for longer than a year. Whether his charges succeed in taking revenge or meet violent ends, each one who dies gives him more power. More power means more wayward mortals seek him out for contracts—and thus the bear will never go hungry.

Trivia
[
edit
|
edit source
]
Volibear was the first champion released in
Season Two
.
He was named after
Travis 'Volibar' George
, from a long running forum meme of him supporting armored bears in the League.
[2]
Volibar
comes from Basque
bolu
"mill" and
ibar
"valley".
[3]
This demi-god's preferred epithet
Valhir
is possibly based on unattested
Old Norse
*
Val
hyrr
[4]
[5]
"fire of the battle-slain";
valr
"battle-slain" is also found in
Valhalla
"hall of the battle-slain" and
Valkyrie
"chooser of the battle-slain".
His other epithet
the Volibear
possibly also contains a variant of
valr
.
His
Ursine
tribe possibly references on real-world
bear worship
and the norse
Berserker
.
Volibear might have been inspired by the
Panserbjørne
(Danish/Norwegian: 'armored bears') from
His Dark Materials
by
Philip Pullman
.
Volibear's dance both before and after his
visual update
references Sam B's
dance
in
America's Got Talent
.
A side-by-side comparison from before his update can be seen
here
.
A side-by-side comparison from after his update can be seen
here
.
In Volibear's '
Champion Spotlight
', his release skin names were erroneously used to label the opposite one (i.e. '
Thunder Lord
' was on '
Northern Storm
' and vice versa).
Rolling Thunder
might be referencing
the eponymous piece
by
Henry Fillmore
and/or
Operation Rolling Thunder
from the
Vietnam War
.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Default damage
Default damage
is dealt by effects that are not otherwise classified, or are deliberately left unclassified. This most common source of
default damage
is splash damage from basic attacks.
Default damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Conqueror
stacking,
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of the damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are

Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind
and
dodge
take precedence over
block
.
Effects that
block
damage will only
block
instances that are
blockable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
blocked
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Shen's
Spirit's Refuge
and is similar though mechanically different to
Dodge

unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

summoner spells
Flash

Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.

Applies life steal
"Applies life steal"
is a
damage tag
that gives an ability the property of having a damage source apply
life steal
like
basic attack damage
would.
This tag is located on some abilities that deal
spell damage
(e.g.
Samira's
Flair
and
Inferno Trigger
) and
items
that deal damage
on-hit
.
Life steal
does not have a penalty for
area of effect
abilities and is always applied to the damage dealt at 100% effectiveness, unless otherwise specified. Unlike
Vamp
, the
"applies life steal"
tag applies life steal directly and does not
heal
based on damage dealt and the life steal
stat
. Therefore healing modifiers that affect
life steal
also affect abilities with the
"applies life steal"
tag.

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.

Basic damage
Basic damage
is the damage dealt by most basic attacks, and a select few abilities. Most sources of
basic damage

basic damage
. For example:
Wit's End
,
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Tiamat
.
Life steal

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.

Zilean's
Chronoshift
Guardian Angel
Anivia's
Rebirth

Zac's
Cell Division
Resurrection

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Ward
Wards
are deployable units that that grant
sight
over the surrounding area. They can only be destroyed by
basic attacks
, granting
gold
and
experience
.
There are three kinds of deployable
wards
available for purchase:
Control Ward
,
Warding Totem
, and
Farsight Alteration
. Other types of wards, such as
Zombie Ward
, are usable through various means.
League of Legends content
Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.
