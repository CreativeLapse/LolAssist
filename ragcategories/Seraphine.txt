Stage Presence
EFFECT RADIUS:
800
SPEED:
3000
Innate - Echo:
Seraphine's
basic ability
casts generate stacks of
Echo
. At max stacks, her next basic ability consumes them all to cast twice in quick succession.
Innate - Harmony:
Seraphine's
ability casts grant
Notes
to her and nearby allied champions, which last a few seconds and stack up to a cap. While any
Notes
are active,
Seraphine's
basic attacks gain
bonus
range
based on total
Notes
, and will fire them all at the target to deal
magic damage
for each
Note
hit.
Innate - Echo:
Seraphine's
basic abilities
generate a
stack
of
Echo
, stacking up to 2 times. At 2 stacks,
Seraphine's
next basic ability casts an additional time for
1 mana
after a
0.
033
seconds
delay, consuming all
Echo
stacks after the
cast time
of the second cast.
Seraphine
gains maximum stacks of
Echo
when the game starts and upon
respawning
.
Innate - Harmony:
Seraphine's
ability casts grant a
Note
to herself and nearby allied
champions
that lasts 6 seconds, refreshes on subsequent
Notes
and stacks up to 4 times on each unit.
While any amount of
Notes
are active,
Seraphine's
next
basic attack
is empowered to have an
uncancellable windup
, gain
25
bonus
attack range
per
Note
, and fire all
Notes
at the target, with each one dealing
4 − 25 (based on level)
(+ 4% AP)
magic damage
, reduced by 75% for
Notes
from allies.

Echo Details:
Echo's
current stacks are represented by a counter under
Seraphine's
health bar
, visible to all players. The last stack is highlighted to indicate that an
Echo
cast is ready.
Seraphine's
basic abilities alternate their icons between 3 different ones each, depending on the current amount of stacks she has.
The additional cast must complete for
Echo
stacks to be consumed; if the cast time does not finish or does not begin at all, or if the ability fails to cast when there is not enough
mana
,
Seraphine
will keep her stacks.
The additional cast does not affect the
cooldown
of the mimicked ability.
The additional cast counts as a separate
cast instance
for the purpose of e.g.
Electrocute
or
Conqueror
.
Harmony Details:
Notes
orbit at a radius of 100 from the center of their holder and they fire from this location.
The empowered attack can
critically strike
.
The empowered attack will not trigger against
wards
.
Notes
are fired one after another with a short delay.
Seraphine
can grant
Notes
to more than 4 allied champions.
Harmony
does
not
grant
Notes
to
clones
.
Harmony
grants
Notes
even if the ally is
untargetable
.
The
Notes
will fire from allies regardless of how far they are away from
Seraphine
.
Seraphine
gains a faint blue attack range indicator when there are
Notes
present.
Notes
do not discharge when attacking
wards
, allowing
Seraphine
to attack them from increased range multiple times.
Other Details:
Seraphine
, while alive, will play music if there is at least one ally champion nearby.
This is audible to
Seraphine
and all allied champions that are in range of
Harmony
, indicative of if they can receive a
Note
or not.

High Note
will fire from wherever
Seraphine
is at the end of the cast time.
The impact delay depends solely on the missile speed. It is 0 seconds to 0.

seconds (after end of cast time) within the standard cast radius, but can be increased further by
Seraphine
being moved away from the cast location during the cast time.
PENDING FOR TEST:
The area of effect is covered via expansion in several rings (similar to
Frozen Tomb's
area of effect) and targets can only be hit once.
The range indicator for the target range has a radius of 950 units, but the center of
High Note
can only be cast up to 900 units. The area indicator shows the proper 350 area of effect radius and cast location.

Surround Sound's

buff can have up to 2 stacks, for a total of 200% shield strength at a time.
Most shields in the game can only have one stack, refreshing their shield strength when reapplied.

Seraphine
has. It does not have to be sourced from
Surround Sound

Surround Sound

The
heal
affects
clones
and counts them for increasing the
missing
health percentage.
A large indicator similar to
Redemption's
signals the heal area of effect and delay.
The heal will be canceled and the indicator disappears when
Seraphine
dies.
The heal occurs instantly on
Seraphine
and all nearby allied champions once the delay ends.
There is a missile that flows through all allied champions which can be blocked by
Wind Wall
. The heal is unaffected by this.
Surround Sound

Tips & Tricks
The
charm
from
Encore
, which is an
immobilize
, can trigger the
stun
from
Beat Drop
.
Beat Drop's
additional effects will always trigger after the application of
other
crowd control
effects when applied at the same time (e.g. the
slow
from
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
will always apply before
Beat Drop
, thus the
root
will always be triggered).

Born in Piltover to Zaunite parents, Seraphine can hear the souls of others—the world sings to her, and she sings back. Though these sounds overwhelmed her in her youth, she now draws on them for inspiration, turning the chaos into a symphony. She performs for the sister cities to remind their citizens that they're not alone, that they're stronger together, and that, in her eyes, their potential is limitless.

Burst
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Burst Mages
aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a devastating barrage of damage from range. They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most vulnerable when they cannot deliver.
Examples
Annie
Syndra
Veigar
League of Legends content
Enchanter
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Enchanters
focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and defending them from incoming threats. Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they really only shine when grouped together with others.
Examples
Janna
Sona

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

Bottom
Within a
drafted team
, the
Bottom Carry
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Support
. Being the most vulnerable, the
Bottom Carry
has to acquire as much gold as possible to purchase key items that will greatly increase their fighting potential.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Bottom Carry
is expected to fulfill the former designation: the position is made for champions that highly depend on item-based power spikes.
Marksmen

Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends

League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp

Cast instance
Cast instance is the identifier that tells the
source
of spells. Multiple spells, such as basic attacks and abilities, under the same cast instance behave as one for certain interactions. Some notable examples:
Conqueror's
stacking can only be triggered once per cast instance.
Electrocute
and
Phase Rush
can only receive 1 stack for their activation per cast instance.
Muramana
deals its damage once per cast instance.
Not to be confused with damage instance, which is each individual effects, even under the same cast instance.

or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet

player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.

damage
they deal is attributed to them alone, but they transfer last hit and kill credit. Killing a

destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles

and
Luden's Companion
.

(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
