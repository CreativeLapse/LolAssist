Duelist's Dance
EFFECT RADIUS:
1200
1350
/
250
ANGLE:
90°
Innate:
Fiora
challenges nearby enemy champions, calling out a direction from which she will try to strike their
Vitals
. A new
Vital
is called out after some time or if one is struck. Striking a vital deals
bonus
true damage
based on the
target's
maximum
health
,
heals
Fiora
and grants her a burst of
movement speed
.
Innate:
Fiora
identifies the
Vitals
of nearby
visible
enemy champions, marked as an arc around them in North-, East-, South- or Westward direction.
Vitals
take 1.
75
seconds to become targetable and linger for 13.
25
seconds afterwards while
Fiora
remains near the target, otherwise the
Vital
will disappear. After a
Vital
ends,
Fiora
identifies a new one on her target.
Dealing damage in the direction of a
Vital
will trigger it to deal
bonus
true damage
equal to
3%
(+ 4% per 100
bonus
AD)
of target's
maximum
health
,
heal
Fiora
for
35 − 100 (based on level)
, and grant her
20 / 30 / 40 / 50% (based on
Grand Challenge's
Rank)
bonus
movement speed
that decays over 1.

Vitals
can be triggered by any source of damage
Fiora
deals, except those with
default damage
and
reactive damage
types.
The
Vitals
are visible to all units.
A
Vital's
angle is fixed to the champion's model and doesn't interact with its orientation.
Vitals
spawn directions alternate in a Northeast-Southwest pattern. Other than that, they have a 50% chance to spawn North or East, or South or West, respectively.
PENDING FOR TEST:
The direction of the first Vital upon
Fiora
and her enemy encountering one another in the game for the first time is always South- or Westward. This is regardless of whether Fiora is in the Blue or Red team.
Vitals
will not trigger if the attack is
dodged
or missed while
Fiora
is
blinded
.
Block
will not prevent a trigger.
If the
Vital
is triggered by
Lunge
, it can be
dodged
, but it can't be
blocked
and will trigger even if
Fiora
is
blinded

bonus
movement speed
at the time of cast:
1100 +
350%
bonus
movement speed
, capped at 1600 maximum dash speed if bonus movement speed is positive.
1100 +

movement speed
, capped at 850 minimum dash speed if bonus movement speed is negative.
Fiora
does not stab if the
dash
is
interrupted
.
Flash
gets sealed during the dash so
Fiora
cannot interrupt herself with it. This also means she cannot buffer
Flash
during the dash for it to be cast right afterward, however.
Fiora
can cast
Hextech Rocketbelt
during the dash, potentially interrupting it based on the timing, preventing the stab if it does.
The dash
can
pass through walls.
The dash has no forgiveness mechanic to clear distant or wider walls with. Any wall wider than 400 units is not crossable.
The stab searches for targets in its radius and prioritizes in order of:
Nearest enemy champion affected by
Grand Challenge
with a
Vital
facing
Fiora
.
Nearest enemy champion
Vital
facing
Fiora
.
Nearest enemy champion affected by

Enemy champion with the lowest percent health out of all champions <20% remaining health.
Nearest enemy champion, minion, or monster within 60% of the radius (
252) with current health below
Lunge's
raw damage.
Nearest enemy champion in the radius check.
Nearest champion in a
rectangular check with 160 width and 450 units length backwards from
Fiora's
current facting direction, ignoring the normal radius check.
Turning
Fiora's
facing direction during the dash (e.g. by casting
Riposte
) can create some very long range hits opposite to her new facing direction, especially against targets with a large gameplay radius.

effect.
Active:
Fiora
enters a defensive stance for 0.

unable to act

turret
damage, and gaining
debuff
immunity and
crowd control immunity
.
Additionally, over the first 0.
6
seconds of the duration,
Fiora
poises to strike, after which she sends a shock with her sword in a line in the target direction, dealing
magic damage
to all enemies hit until colliding with an enemy champion.
Magic Damage:

Riposte
is not
invulnerability
but instead reduces any damage to her by 100% late into the damage event. Because of this, it interacts differently with effects triggered from damage:
Life steal

Riposte
is and is not prioritized over certain effects:

will block effects before

Black Shield
will negate
crowd control
before
Riposte
.
Riposte
will not be able to apply its
stun

and not any other external source to do so.

The most feared duelist in all Valoran, Fiora is as renowned for her brusque manner and cunning mind as she is for the speed of her bluesteel rapier. Born to House Laurent in the kingdom of Demacia, Fiora took control of the family from her father in the wake of a scandal that nearly destroyed them. House Laurent's reputation was sundered, but Fiora bends her every effort to restore her family's honor and return them to their rightful place among the great and good of Demacia.

If one dares to gaze upon the crown, they'll immediately catch the careful eye of Fiora, the captain of the Royal Guard. Cunning, keen, and shrewd, she's written her own legend at the tip of her rapier, a legend so large that it's said, as a child, she could slice a falling leaf perfectly in half. Whether or not it's true... Fiora has never told.

Dignified and exacting, Fiora challenged all who misused their power. But her true test appeared in her own gilded dreams: a duel with herself, her greatest enemy. She defeated this other self, impressing the Defiance Dragon. Both dragon and chosen laughed as she raised her chin while receiving its blessing, cementing her worthiness.

Nobles in the cutthroat queendom of Telum conspired against Fiora's rise to power, taking her eye and proclaiming her dead. Yet from flowers and flame she arose, then prevailed, in the Grand Coronation. Queen Fiora now oversees arms manufacturing in her nation's steel gardens, and secures her succession by training and tempering a certain fiery princess.

Duelist's Dance
(I)
Fiora
identifies the
Vitals
of all nearby enemy champions, which consists of a 90° section of the target's hit box.
Vitals
take 0.
5
second to identify and last for 15 seconds, after which she will immediately begin identifying a new
Vital
. Basic attacks against
Vitals
deal bonus true damage, as well as restoring a small amount of health and granting a short burst of speed.
Lunge
(Q)
Active:
Fiora
lunges forward a short distance in the target direction, then lunges again to strike a nearby enemy dealing physical damage and applying on-hit effects. The second lunge is auto-targeted and prioritizes exposed
Vitals
.
Riposte
(W)
Active:
Fiora
poises to strike in the target direction and then enters a defensive stance, parrying all damaging and immobilizing effects for the next 0.
75
seconds. After the duration,
Fiora
stabs her sword forward dealing damage and briefly
slowing
the first enemy champion she strikes. If
Fiora
parries at least one immobilizing effect,
Riposte
will
stun
instead.
Bladework
(E)
Active:
Fiora
gains 50% bonus attack speed on her next two attacks. The first attack cannot critically strike but applies a
slow
, while the second benefits from 100% critical strike chance.
Grand Challenge
(R)
Active:
Fiora
targets an enemy champion, highlighting all four of their
Vitals
for the next few seconds. If Fiora is able to attack all four
Vitals
, or if she destroys at least one before the target dies,
Fiora
creates a ~600 radius zone that substantially heals
Fiora
and allies within the area over the next 5 seconds. While within 600 units of her target and while within the healing zone,
Fiora
gains bonus movement speed.
Duelist's Dance
will not identify new
Vitals
while
Fiora's
target has at least one exposed.

]
Fiora is
voiced
by
Karen Strassman
, who also voices
Cassiopeia
,
Shyvana
and
Zyra
.
Karen Strassman also voices her in
Legends of Runeterra
.
[2]
Fiora's fighting style references
Fencing
while she herself might have been inspired by
Julie d'Aubigny
.
[3]
Her taunt references the 'salute' from duel tradition.
In her joke, Fiora draws
Teemo's
face in the air.
Her dance references
Fred Astaire's
to the tune of
Puttin' On the Ritz
in
Blue Skies
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
Fiora
derives from
Sabine
theonym
Flora
, from Proto-Italic
*flōs
[4]
plus
feminine suffix
-a
.
Her name might be referencing
Fiore dei Liberi
and/or
Fioretto
(Italian: 'foil')
Her house's name is a reference to
Nicolo Laurent
, former CEO of Riot Games.
Alex 'Skribbles' Yee
chose his surname without even telling him and because he was "
the only french person he knows
".
Having become CEO years after, Laurent only discovered this
easter egg
during the production of
Legends of Runeterra
.

Riposte
and

Fiora's Riposte

Riposte
are named after the
eponymous fencing move
, but its effect is more akin to a
Parry
, alongside a Riposte.

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Juggernauts

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Heal
Healing
replenishes a unit's
current
health
, but never above their
maximum
health

Incoming heals can trigger bonus effects from

Sight
Sight
is a property of

that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range

Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge

blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge

Blind
A unit that is
blinded

Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.

stasis
.
