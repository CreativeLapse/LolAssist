Notes
Upheaval's
missile cannot collide with structures; they are an invalid target. Structures within the radius of an explosion will be hit as they are valid targets to the effect.
Upheaval's
effect values are based on the effect values of the third attack of
Shattered Earth
.
It applies the bonus damage of an empowered attack as well as its bonus health scaling plus the third attack's additional percent health damage.
It applies a slow effect that is the same strength and duration as the slow applied with the third attack.
Both slows from both abilities apply a generic slow debuff.
Spell shield
will not prevent the explosion from occurring.
This ability will cast from wherever the caster is at the end of the cast time.

COOLDOWN
:
20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16
CAST TIME:

COLLISION RADIUS:
160
Active:
Skarner
charges in the target direction for a duration while ignoring terrain collision and having
slow immunity
. He starts slowly but ramps up in
movement speed
over the course of the charge, and is able to steer himself increasingly fast when keeping the same direction.
Ixtal's Impact
can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after the duration. Colliding with an enemy
champion
or large
monster
causes
Skarner
to increase his
movement speed
, forcibly grab them to
attach
them to him, and
suppress
them while dragging them along for the remainder of the charge. If the attached target collides with terrain while grabbed, they are
stunned
and dealt
physical damage
, ending the charge, and reducing
Ixtal's Impact
cooldown
.
Recast:
Skarner
ends
Ixtal's Impact
early.
Active:
Skarner
charges forward in the direction of the cursor for up to 2.
75
seconds, during which he gains
slow immunity
, becomes
ghosted
, ignores
terrain
collision, and has
unobstructed vision
of the surrounding 650 units. He automatically navigates his movement along the way and is able to steer himself with a slow turn rate that increases over time, resetting upon changing direction.
Ixtal's Impact
can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after the duration.
Skarner
begins the charge at a
static amount
of
150 movement speed
that increases by
100
every
0.
264
seconds
, up to
950
total
movement speed
by the end of the duration. If
Skarner
collides with an enemy
champion
or large
monster
, he grabs them with his claws for the time of the remaining charge,
attaching
them to himself,
suppressing
them,
revealing
them, increasing the charge's turn rate to the maximum, and gaining
300
bonus
movement speed
, with a minimum total of
650
and a maximum total of
1150
. If a target has been grabbed before the first 1.
75
seconds of the charge, the remaining duration is set to 1 second, and set to 0.
5
seconds otherwise. The charge does not ramp up in speed while a target is grabbed.
If
Skarner's
attached target collides with terrain while being held, the charge ends, detaching them from him, dealing
physical damage
,
stunning
them for 1.
5
seconds, and reducing
Ixtal's Impact's
cooldown
by 35%.
Physical Damage:
30 / 60 / 90 / 120 / 150
(+ 6% of his
maximum
health)
Recast:
Skarner
ends
Ixtal's Impact
. If a target has been grabbed, he detaches them from himself.
Ixtal's Impact ends immediately if
Skarner
becomes
immobilized
,
grounded
, or
silenced
during the charge, detaching the grabbed target. While the target is grabbed, they are attached to
Skarner
in a position that is directly in front of him.

While
Ixtal's Impact
is active,
Skarner's
movement speed is set to a static amount that cannot change by any means other than by the ability itself.
Any movement speed modifiers gained before or during the charge are retained however, and will take effect after the charge if the duration permits.
The
bonus
movement speed
from grabbing a target is
300
only if
Skarner's
movement speed was between
350
and
850
at the time.
If
Skarner
was at less than
350 movement speed
when he grabbed the target, his total movement speed is instead set to
650
. If he was at
950 movement speed
, his total movement speed is set to the cap of
1150
.
Skarner
gains a slightly larger field of view during
Ixtal's Impact's
charge.
Ixtal's Impact's
attachment depends on the application of the
suppression
; if the suppression is not applied, neither is the attachment. Similarly, if the suppression is removed, so is the attachment.
If the target resists the suppression through
total crowd control immunity
,
displacement immunity
, or a
spell shield
.
Skarner
will not attach them to himself, causing the charge to end instantly. The collision's damage is special-cased to still apply to a target under these effects immediately upon contact.
If the target removes the suppression by any means, including with an applicable
cleanse
effect or
dispel
, they will detach themselves from
Skarner
immediately which forces the charge to end instantly and not apply any damage.
Skarner
can move up to 550 units beyond the outer-edge of the battlefield with the charge.
Once he has surpassed this boundary,
Ixtal's Impact
ends immediately and
Skarner
is moved to the nearest valid space.
Ixtal's Impact
can interact with
player-generated terrain
.
If
Skarner
is inside terrain when the effect ends, he will be moved to the nearest valid space.
Enemies cannot see
Skarner
while he is inside terrain, unless they grant sight into the area of terrain he is inside (such as with
Hawkshot
or
Heightened Senses
) or have
unobstructed vision
.
However, enemies will be notified when
Skarner
is inside nearby terrain while within a certain distance of him. An indicator will be visible to the enemy player's perspective to represent this.

If a target resists the suppression by being

Skarner

If all targets hit resist the suppression,
Skarner

If all targets remove the suppression,

Skarner is an immense crystalline scorpion from a hidden valley in Shurima. Part of the ancient Brackern race, Skarner and his kin are known for their great wisdom and deep connection to the land, as their souls are fused with powerful life crystals which hold the living thoughts and memories of their ancestors. In an age long past, the Brackern entered hibernation to avoid untold magical destruction, but recent, threatening events have roused Skarner. As the only Brackern awake, he strives to protect his kind from those who seek to harm them.

Trust not the whispers on the prairie winds, humming and hymning of the way home. Lost souls hear the Demon of the Old Deserts, the supposed Savior of the Wayward, long before they feel his hellish tremor. His voice rings out, crooning of safety, of protection. Reject this demon's tune—or be embalmed with sin and sand to join his mummified masses.

Once the guardian of an ancient civilization, Skarner was forced to watch it collapse before his eyes. He clings to a desperate hope that one day he and his companion can rebuild what was ripped away. Until then, he vows to remain vigilant, deterring any trespassers who dare threaten the ruins and the magic that pulses through them.

Trivia
[

]
Skarner, the Primordial Sovereign
During the cast time,
Impale's
decal displays the
Ixtali
Axiomata
.
His dance is a reference to
Crab Rave
. This dance can also be synchronized with other Skarners.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
Some animations resemble his pre-rework ones:
He has kept the same pose for his
joke emote
.
Part of the old dance where he swings his claws in a circle can be shown during the restart segment of his current dance loop.
His previous two 'slash' animations (one for the left claw, and one for the right) used during
Crystal Slash's
cast resemble part of his laugh emote.
Skarner, the Crystal Vanguard
Skarner was deemed overpowered and obnoxious in
Ultra Rapid Fire
(2014 edition) and was ultimately disabled in non-custom games.
Skarner had his game assets reused for several
featured game modes
!
He was given a retexture and features as a monster called the "Draggy Tail Monster" in
Invasion
.
Skarner is the only unit that was retextured for this mode that isn't a
Voidborn
.
His animations were reused for the
Crimson Stinger
and
Petal Claw
monsters  in
Odyssey: Extraction
.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Impale
COOLDOWN:
120 / 105 / 90
Active:
Skarner
winds up his stingers over the cast time with
displacement immunity
, then lashes them forward in the target direction, dealing
magic damage
to enemies hit and impaling up to 3 of the closest enemy champions within the area to briefly
suppress
. While suppressed, the targets are
revealed
and
attached
to
Skarner
. If he successfully impales at least one enemy champion,
Skarner
gains
bonus
movement speed

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).

Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable
. Note that these are specified in the ability details on the Wiki.
Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged
, unless otherwise stated.
This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike

Nilah's
Jubilant Veil

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0
, but does not prevent effects that trigger from damage.
Blind

Effects that
block
damage will only
block

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of
Arcane Comet
,
Unleashed Smite
, and
Primal Smite
which will be blocked.

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.
League of Legends content
Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.
League of Legends content
Ixtal's Impact
COOLDOWN:
20 / 19 / 18 / 17 / 16
Active:
Skarner
charges in the target direction for a duration while ignoring terrain collision and having
slow immunity
. He starts slowly but ramps up in
movement speed
over the course of the charge, and is able to steer himself increasingly fast when keeping the same direction.
Ixtal's Impact
can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after the duration.
Colliding with an enemy
champion
or large
monster
causes
Skarner
to increase his
movement speed
, forcibly grab them to
attach
them to him, and
suppress
them while dragging them along for the remainder of the charge. If the attached target collides with terrain while grabbed, they are
stunned
and dealt
physical damage
, ending the charge, and reducing
Ixtal's Impact
cooldown
.
Recast:
Skarner
ends
Ixtal's Impact
early.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).
League of Legends content
Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
. Shield reduction effects, exclusively
Serpent's Fang
, reduce all incoming and outgoing
shields

Attached
Attached
refers to the state of a unit whose movement is bound entirely to another object, such as a unit or missile. They will be at the current location of the unit they are attached to at all times, or at a specific offset to that location.
A unit can either attach themselves to another unit or attach another unit to themselves. In any case, the unit that has units attached to them can move those units by any means of movement, whether it be by pathing (movement commands), displacement (
dashes
and
forced displacement
), or
blinks
. The unit that is being attached to another unit however cannot move from their current location by themselves by any means, including the use of the aforementioned movement methods.

Ghosted
A unit that is

ignores
unit collision
, allowing them to move through other units, or other units to move through them.
League of Legends content
Unobstructed vision
A unit with
unobstructed sight
can see the full circle of their
vision
radius, ignoring all obstructions and being able to see into terrain. This effect does not allow the user to see into
brush
, although they will be able to see beyond the brush if within range.
Having
unobstructed sight
will benefit all forms of vision, including
true sight
and
camouflage
detection - i.e. you will be able to reveal stealthed units over walls where usually terrain would block true sight.
Nearsight
prevents this vision entirely; the user's sight radius will not infiltrate beyond terrain.
