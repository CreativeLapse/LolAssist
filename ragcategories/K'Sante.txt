Dauntless Instinct
Innate:
K'Sante's
abilities mark enemies hit for a short time. His basic attacks consume the mark to deal
bonus
physical damage
based on the
target's
maximum
health
.
All Out
Bonus:
The damage dealt upon consuming a mark is increased based on
K'Sante's
bonus
armor
and
magic resist
. The mark damage is converted to
true damage
.
Innate:
K'Sante's
abilities
mark enemies hit for 4 seconds. His
basic attacks
against marked enemies are empowered to consume the mark
on-hit
, dealing
20
(+
1% − 2% (based on level)
of target's
maximum
health)
bonus
physical damage
. The health-based portion deals a minimum of
15 − 100 (based on level)
damage against
minions
and
20 − 105 (based on level)
against
monsters
.
All Out
Bonus:
K'Sante's
basic attacks and
ability damage
, as well as
Dauntless Instinct's
mark consumption, are empowered to deal
bonus
physical damage
equal to
1%
(+ 1% per 100
bonus
armor)
(+ 1% per 100
bonus
magic resistance)
of the target's

will block the mark's application, but not the mark's consumption from an attack.
The empowered attack can be
dodged
,
blocked
, and missed while
blinded
but the mark will not be consumed.
Starting the empowered attack while the mark is about to time out will not extend the mark duration, but still complete the attack and apply the bonus damage.
All Out's bonus damage on abilities only applies to the first target hit when damaging multiple enemies (including minions and monsters).
(bug)
For most of
K'Sante's
spells and item effects, in the case of multiple targets being stuck on the same game tick, this refers to the closest target. For non-missile
Ntofo Strikes
, it instead depends on the order in which the target units were spawned into the match.

Active:
K'Sante
roots
an enemy and then shatters his tonfas,
knocking them back
,
blinking
behind them, and dealing
physical damage
. If the enemy is pushed into terrain, they will be knocked over it and take additional
physical damage
. The target is
stunned
at the end of the push, and also
knocked up
again if they were pushed through terrain. At the end,
K'Sante
goes
All Out
for some time.
All Out:
K'Sante
loses a large portion of his
health
,
base
armor
and
magic resist
, but gains
bonus
AD
and
omnivamp
. His basic abilities are empowered and they have no
mana
cost.
K'Sante
can recast this ability to end
All Out
early. After
All Out
ends,
K'Sante
restores his mana, but his health is
not restored
.
Active:
K'Sante
roots
the target enemy
champion
for
0.
5
seconds
and gains
displacement immunity
over the cast time. He then shatters his ntofos,
pulling
the target to a location that is 300 units in the cast direction from their location at the time of cast, during which they are
revealed
, and
blinking
175 units
behind that location. The target is dealt
physical damage
near the end of the displacement and is
stunned
for 0.
3
seconds once it ends.
Physical Damage:
80 / 115 / 150
If there is
valid terrain
350 units in the cast direction from the target's location at the time of cast, the target is instead
pulled
to a location that is directly 450 units away from the edge of the other side of the terrain and
K'Sante
blinks
100 units behind that location, dealing them the
physical damage
near their emergence from the terrain. At the end of the displacement, they remain
airborne
for
0.
264
seconds
, after which they are
stunned
for 0.
5
seconds.
K'Sante
strikes them after
0.
132
seconds
into the airborne duration to deal
physical damage
.
Strike Physical Damage:
80 / 115 / 150
(+ 5% of his
bonus
health)
Total Physical Damage:
160 / 230 / 300
(+ 5% of his
bonus
health)
After
K'Sante
blinks
, he enters
All Out
for 15 seconds.
All Out:
K'Sante
gains a
health threshold
equal to
65%
maximum
health
which cannot be
modified
nor
exceeded
by any means. Upon entering
All Out
, his
current
health
is reduced to this threshold if it is above it. Additionally, his
base
armor
and
base
magic resistance
are reduced by
85%
bonus
armor
and
85%
bonus
magic resistance
, respectively. In return, he gains
bonus
attack speed
,
50%
bonus
-armor penetration
, and
20% omnivamp
, and modifies his basic abilities which can be cast at no cost.
Upon entering
All Out
,
K'Sante
is restored to
100%
maximum
mana
. His
mana
then decays to
0
over the duration of the buff, after which the
amount of
mana
he had
prior to entering
All Out
is restored.
Bonus Attack Speed:
40 / 60 / 80%
K'Sante
retains his
maximum
health
and
bonus
resistances during All Out. Health lost from gaining the health threshold is
not
restored after the effect ends. If the target is pulled over terrain that is longer than
2000
units,
K'Sante
will
vanish
during their displacement and reappear near the end of it.

If the terrain behind the target is invalid by not having an opposite side,
All Out
will not trigger its additional effects from pulling the target over terrain.
The pull destination in this case would be inside terrain and thus the displacement would stop at the boundary.
K'Sante
will restore the exact amount of
mana
he had before going
All Out
after the buff expires.
The amount does not change even if his
maximum
mana
changes during the effect.
While the target is being
pulled
over terrain, they are additionally
attached
to a missile that travels in the same trajectory as the displacement, becoming detached afterwards.
Removing the
airborne
debuff will not cause the target to detach from the missile.
K'Sante
will blink 175 units beyond the target's hitbox's edge at the end location.
If the target resists the
pull
by having a
spell shield
or being
immune to crowd control
or
displacement immune
,
K'Sante
will still blink beyond the pull's end location as if the target were displaced.
All Out's
remaining duration is tracked in his secondary resource bar.
All Out
does not interact with
player-generated terrain
.
K'Sante's
strike at the end of the displacement when the target is pulled over terrain does not apply
Dauntless Instinct's
mark.
Going
All Out
does not override
K'Sante's
attack or movement commands if the target does not collide with terrain.
If the target is however pulled through terrain then
K'Sante
will be ordered to basic attack the target afterwards.
The percentage bonus armor penetration stacks additively with other sources of percentage armor penetration.
(note)
Since
K'Sante
retains the stats he "lost", any effects that scale based on those stats will calculate based on the value prior to him going
All Out
.
His
base
resistances can be reduced below 0 by his
bonus
resistances.
All Out
will not take into account resistances gained through % bonuses (eg.
Conditioning
,
Mountainous Vigor
, etc) when reducing
K'Sante's base
resistances.
(bug)
Jak'Sho, The Protean's
Voidborn Resilience
specifically is taken into account.
Gaining
bonus
health during
All Out
causes the health threshold to be briefly increased then reset back to its original value.
The
bonus
health is still applied to his
current
health.
All Out's
granted
untargetability
from the
vanish
during the target's pull of over 2000 units does not
destroy
in-flight
projectiles
.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on
cooldown
nor pay its cost (if applicable).

Defiant and courageous, K'Sante battles colossal beasts and ruthless Ascended to protect his home of Nazumah, a coveted oasis amid the sands of Shurima. But after a falling-out with his former partner, K'Sante realizes that in order to become a warrior worthy of leading his city, he must temper his single-minded drive for success. Only then can he avoid falling prey to his own pride and find the wisdom he needs to defeat the vicious monsters threatening his people.

K'Sante prides himself on leading under adversity, but this is a challenge unlike any other. His realm is gone, he's living on borrowed time, and the other Empyreans don't realize that something released the Foreglow. Something bad. He knows only they can fix it, but they need their eyes opened. They need a leader.

An awe-inspiring presence—physically, emotionally, vocally—K'Sante is always focused on the bigger picture, determined for HEARTSTEEL to make its mark on the music industry. Though in his solo career his ambition often outpaced what one man can do alone, now that he's found friends and collaborators he believes in, K'Sante knows nothing can stop them.

Active:
K'Sante
roots
the target enemy

seconds and gains
displacement immunity
over the cast time, then shatters his tonfas to

early.
K'Sante
retains his
maximum
health
and

resistances during All Out. Health lost from All Out is
not
restored after the effect ends. Upon going All Out,
K'Sante
is restored to
100%
maximum
mana
which rapidly decays over the duration. His
mana
percentage prior to All Out is preserved and is gained back after the effect ends. If the target is knocked over terrain that is longer than

Warden
Tanks
excel in shrugging off incoming damage and focus on disrupting their enemies more than being significant damage threats themselves.
Wardens
are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently locking down any on-comers who try to pass them. Wardens keep their allies out of harm’s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray.
Examples
Braum

Skirmisher
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Skirmishers
(also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches. Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful defensive tools to survive in the fray, along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

All Out
COOLDOWN:
120 / 100 / 80
Active:
K'Sante
roots
an enemy and then shatters his tonfas,
knocking them back
,
blinking
behind them, and dealing
physical damage
. If the enemy is pushed into terrain, they will be knocked over it and take additional
physical damage
.
The target is
stunned
at the end of the push, and also
knocked up
again if they were pushed through terrain. At the end,
K'Sante
goes
All Out
for some time.
All Out:
K'Sante
loses a large portion of his
health
,
base
armor
and
magic resist
, but gains
bonus
AD
and
omnivamp
. His basic abilities are empowered and they have no
mana
cost.
K'Sante
can recast this ability to end
All Out
early.
After
All Out
ends,
K'Sante
restores his mana, but his health is
not restored

League of Legends content
Basic attack
The
basic attack
(or
auto-attack
) is the most basic means of a unit to deal damage to another unit, usually dealing
100% AD
. It has a brief cooldown based on the caster's current
attack speed
.
All
basic attacks
are normally unit-targeted with their range limited by the caster's
attack range
, and have a brief attack
windup
. Damage is then dealt depending on the caster's range type:
Melee
and some projectile-less ranged attacks deal damage immediately.
Ranged
attacks usually send a projectile that follows the target and deals damage upon striking them. Projectiles can be intercepted by certain
blocking
effects.
The damage event will trigger
on-hit effects
from buffs the caster may hold. If damage cannot be dealt, on-hit effects will not be triggered.
On-attack
effects will always trigger when the attack's
windup
completes.

Minion
Minions
are autonomous units that spawn periodically from their nexus and advance along the lanes toward the enemy nexus. They

League of Legends content
Proc damage
Proc damage
is damage type assigned to most on-hit effects. It is worth noting that many seeming on-hit effects are actually classified as
spell damage
and so will trigger ability effects. Some forms of on-hit damage, such as by
Blade of the Ruined King
and
Spellblade
, also benefit from
life steal
.
Proc damage
does not interact with most other effects, such as
Luden's Companion
or
Arcane Comet
. The main exception is:
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Effects triggered by damage subtypes will still occur in spite of proc damage's non-reactive nature (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

miss
their

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades
does not consume a
stack
from successful
attack resets

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Projectile
A
projectile
or
missile
is any entity not classified as a unit (
champion
,
minion
,
monster
, etc.
) that travels at any given velocity.
Moving units are
not
considered projectiles under any circumstance (
including
dashing
units,
airborne
units, or units thrown by some abilities such as
Force of Will
or
Roar of the Slayer
.
).
Braum's
Unbreakable

Some
ranged
basic attacks (
including
turrets
) and abilities don't use projectiles and will bypass projectile-blocking effects.
Some abilities will
destroy
all currently incoming homing projectiles.

Resurrection
A unit that is protected by
Resurrection
will enter a revival state and dispel most debuffs upon taking
fatal damage
. After the state completes, the unit is revived.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.
The following
crowd control
effects will
interrupt
all
channels
(except unstoppable ones):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
Flee
,
Taunt

Silence
(
Disrupt

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Crowd control
A unit that is
disabled
is affected by a status effect that prevents certain actions – such as movement, attacking, casting and/or seeing–blocked, reduced or controlled.
Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.
