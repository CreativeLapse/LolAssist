Traveler's Call
Innate - Ancient Chimes:
Bard's
presence causes magical
chimes
to appear across the map. Collecting a
chime
grants him
experience
,
mana
, and a burst of
movement speed
.
Meeps:
Bard
generates
meeps
that are each consumed in his basic attacks, dealing
bonus
magic damage
. Collecting
chimes
causes these
meeps
to be ready more often and gain new effects.
At
5 chimes
,
Meeps
apply a
slow
to enemies.
At
15 chimes
,
Meeps
deal damage to nearby enemies and in a cone behind the target.
At
35 chimes
, the cone's radius increases.
Innate - Ancient Chimes:
Bard's
presence causes sacred
Chimes
to appear at random locations on the map, lingering for up to 10 minutes. Collecting a
Chime
restores
12%
maximum
mana
and grants
Bard
20 + (
1 per minute after 5 minutes
) experience
, as well as
24%
bonus
movement speed
out of combat
for 20 seconds, which stacks up to 10 times. Each
Chime
collected beyond the first instead grants an additional
14%
bonus
movement speed
, up to a total of
150%
bonus
movement speed
.
Bard
empowers his
Meeps
each time he collects
5 Chimes
.
Innate - Meeps:
Bard's
presence attracts
Meeps
, which are small spirits that come to his side. While he has
Meeps
, his basic attacks are empowered to each consume a
Meep
on-attack
to deal
35
(
+
10
per 5
Chimes
collected
)
(+ 40% AP)
bonus
magic damage
.
At
5 Chimes
,
Meeps
slow
damaged enemies by
25% − 75% (based on number of
Chimes
)
for 1 second.
At
15 Chimes
,
Meeps
deal the damage to enemies within 150 units of the primary target as well as those in a cone behind them.
At
35 Chimes
, the cone's radius increases.
Meeps
spawn every
8 − 4 (based on number of Chimes)
seconds and
Bard
can have up to
1 − 9 (based on number of Chimes)
of them at a time.

Chime
spawns are weighted towards the areas of the map that
Bard
is currently present in, and spawn every 50 seconds in pairs, with the only exception being the second and third spawns on
Summoner's Rift
, which spawn only one.
Chimes
will not spawn in either team's base and will not spawn in the enemy team's jungle before the 5 minute mark.
Only
Bard
can see a
chime
that is in the
fog of war
. All other players must have
sight
of a
chime
for it to be visible to them.
Only
Bard
can see a minimap icon for an uncollected
chime
, regardless of whether other players have vision on it or not. The minimap icon will turn red when the
chime
is one minute away from expiration.
Bard
cannot see
chimes
while
nearsighted
.
Only
Meep
cone attacks are absorbed by
spell shields
. Those that deal damage together with the basic attack don't.
If a
Meep
empowered auto attack is
dodged
,
blocked
or when
Bard
is
blinded
, the basic attack itself will deal no damage, but the
Meep
damage will still be applied.
The empowered attack will not trigger against

conjures a shrine at the target location that gathers power over 5 seconds, granting
sight

Type
Caretaker's Shrine
can be cast directly on an ally and it will be treated as a
unit-targeted
ability for effects such as
Guardian
. This version also has a
forgiveness radius
of 175 units.
If
Bard
has 3
shrines
on the map and creates a new one that is cast directly on himself or an ally, the oldest shrine will not be destroyed. This is because the
shrine
is used as an actual targeted heal on himself or someone else, and not a permanent shrine, so the other 3 may stay.
The
spell indicator
of
Caretaker's Shrine
shows the area in which it can be used as a targeted heal. After a shrine has been placed on the ground its activation area becomes smaller: allies or enemies have to step directly on the shrine to use it or destroy it.
Leveling up
Caretaker's Shrine
will update the healing of existing shrines.

A traveler from beyond the stars, Bard is an agent of serendipity who fights to maintain a balance where life can endure the indifference of chaos. Many Runeterrans sing songs that ponder his extraordinary nature, yet they all agree that the cosmic vagabond is drawn to artifacts of great magical power. Surrounded by a jubilant choir of helpful spirit meeps, it is impossible to mistake his actions as malevolent, as Bard always serves the greater good… in his own odd way.

Bard is a creature of the old world, they say, older than the great forest, and older even than the seeds it sprouted from. Few records remain of the age before the gods, but it is likely Bard predates them—a truly primordial being, tending the land since time's first dawn.

Though playing a famously unpopular Riftquest character class, Bard Bard has turned the ancient art of song into a reality-altering weapon of death. Unfortunately his turns take forever, since he has no concept of linear time and speaks in those weird “bwong” sounds.

Bard is a wandering wordless connoisseur of the finest cafes. If he leaves behind a blessing in the form of a teacup? A hundred years of sweet success. No one knows where the Teapot Troubadour came from, or if he has a purpose beyond delighting in patisserie, but a visit from Bard instantly puts any cafe on the map!

The god of plants, Bard is constantly on the move to replenish nature. As caretaker of the sacred trees of Dusk and Dawn, he's fashioned one of their broken branches into a horn capable of letting him travel anywhere within the Scrolls. He knows the mad god Jhin would use that power for his own gain, but Bard will stake his life to prevent it.

Bard
is one of 15 champions that have an ability that infinitely stacks an effect:
Aurelion Sol
,
Bel'Veth
,
Cho'Gath
,
Draven
,
Kindred
,
Nasus

In Bard's case,
Traveler's Call
infinitely stacks the base
magic damage
of his
Meeps
.
Curiously enough,
The Wonder Above
is the antithesis of
The Terror Beneath
, going so far as to both having a portal-opening ability (
Magical Journey
and
Tunnel
) as well as an enemy-destructible object-placing one (
Caretaker's Shrine
and

Catcher
Controllers
are defensive casters that oversee the battlefield by protecting and opening up opportunities for their allies.
Catchers
specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by creating intense zones of threat that only foolish enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down.
Examples
Blitzcrank
Morgana
Zyra
League of Legends content
Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.
League of Legends content
Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision
.
Enchanters
,
Catchers
,
Wardens
and
Burst Mages
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Support
position.
League of Legends content
Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.
Reduction:
The
duration

Tenacity

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of

you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Nearsight
A unit that is
nearsighted
has their
sight
radius reduced and
cannot
see beyond their sight radius.
While nearsighted, units cannot reveal
stealthed
wards
or
traps
. Nearsighted units lose vision of all their allies as well as all external sources of vision (including from wards or abilities). This prevents
unit-targeted
effects, including
basic attacks
, from being used outside of the unit's reduced sight radius.
True sight
and
unobstructed vision
do
not
bypass the vision blocked by
nearsight
.
Sources of
nearsight
do
not
stack with each other; only the application with the greatest sight reduction will take effect.
Interrupts:
Interrupts target commands if the
nearsighted
unit's target is outside of their new vision area and prevents
automated target acquisition
.
Reduction:
The
duration
is unaffected by
Tenacity
.
Resist:
Resisted by
crowd control immunity
with the exceptions of
Fiora's
Riposte

Morgana's
Black Shield
.
Removal:
Removed by
Cleanses

Crowd control applied by one's self or an ally cannot be countered in any way, neither
reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Spell shield
A
spell shield
refers to one of several effects that have the capacity to negate hostile abilities from applying to the recipient. A
spell shield
may negate many active effects coming from
champion abilities
,
epic monsters
,
champion summoned units
, and
items
, but almost none from
runes
and
summoner spells
with the only exceptions of

Dodge
Dodging

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge

Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks

Howling Abyss
The Howling Abyss is a bottomless crevasse located in the coldest, cruelest, part of the
Freljord

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Heal
Healing
replenishes a unit's
current
health
, but never above their
maximum
health
.
Incoming heals can trigger bonus effects from
Overheal
. Outgoing heals can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
.

Targeting forgiveness
Certain unit-targeted abilities present an accuracy-grace system called
targeting forgiveness
.
When no valid target is
directly selected
upon using the ability, it will automatically search for one within a certain
center-to-center
forgiveness radius
. If a valid target is found within the forgiveness radius, the ability will automatically acquire them and cast on them. If multiple targets are found, the nearest one to the forgiveness radius' center is chosen.
Only ally-targeted abilities may utilize this system. Not to be confused with a different, priority-based system that a few other spells (e.g.
Smite
) use.
League of Legends content
Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Stealth
Stealth
renders a unit invisible to enemies and grants
ghosting
, allowing a unit to tread without being
visible
to enemies.
Stealthed
units within sight will briefly shimmer their silhouette upon taking damage, exposing their current position.
Stealth
is split into three categories:
Invisibility
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
.
Camouflage
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
, being within a certain detection radius of enemy
champions
, and nearby
Control Wards
.
Stealthed trap
: The unit
can
only
be
revealed by
True Sight
,
Control Wards
,
Oracle Lens
, and
A Harmless Scarecrow
.
Unit-targeted
effects cannot be cast upon stealthed units as the caster is unable to select the target without seeing them.
Stealth
is not a form of
untargetability
; units can still be hit by effects that do not require vision of targets, such as skill-shots,
auto-targeted
, and
location-targeted
effects.
Certain actions break
stealth
. This can include, but is not limited to:
basic attacking
, casting an
ability
, activating an
item
, using a
summoner spell
, and taking damage. The interaction can vary among certain cases.
League of Legends content
Interrupt
Interrupt
is a quality of crowd control that
interrupts
an in-progress effect, preventing its completion or causing the effect to go off at an
interrupted
state.
The following crowd control effects
interrupt
channeled and charged
abilities (unless otherwise noted by the ability):
Airborne
Forced action
(
Charm
,
