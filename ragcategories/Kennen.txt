More than just the lightning-quick enforcer of Ionian balance, Kennen is the only yordle member of the Kinkou. Despite his small, furry stature, he is eager to take on any threat with a whirling storm of shuriken and boundless enthusiasm. Alongside his master Shen, Kennen patrols the spirit realm, employing devastating electrical energy to strike down his enemies.

]
His dance references the
Airflare
, a
breakdance move
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here.
He shares this dance with
Camille
.
Her dance is very similar to
PROJECT: Vayne's
, whose dance is a similar breakdance move.
Kennen used to gain the
'Law of Inverse Ninja Strength'
cosmetic
Easter egg
debuff (
"This unit is a flippin' ninja!"
-
"Ninjas are more effective when they work alone. For every Ninja on your team beyond yourself, you lose 1 health."
) when he,
Akali
,
Shen
, and/or
Zed
found themselves on the same team. It was removed in
V3.14
for unknown reasons.

Mage (Legacy)
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
League of Legends content
Marksman (Legacy)
Marksman
(formerly known as 'Carry') excel at dealing reliable sustained damage at range (usually through basic attacks) while constantly skirting the edge of danger.

Top
Within a
drafted team
, the
Top Laner
is the champion assigned to the top lane.
Juggernauts
,

League of Legends content
Energy
Energy
is a resource designed to limit how much a champion is able to use their
basic
abilities during a set time frame rather than through the use of
mana
. It is represented by a
yellow
bar instead of
blue
.
Energy
has a maximum of
200
(except for
Shen
, with
400
), and regenerates rapidly, at a rate of
10 energy
per second. This means that energy champions are not at risk of depleting their resource over a long period of time, however the small capacity restricts the rapid usage of multiple spells.
League of Legends content
Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Stun
A unit that is
stunned
is unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash
,
Teleport

, and
Mark

magic damage
. Enemies take increased damage from each subsequent strike.
League of Legends content
Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
On-attack
On-attack
effects refer to various instances that are triggered by the user when they finish their attack windup.
Unlike on-hit, on-attack effects do not require the user to land their basic attacks, only to finish their windup.
League of Legends content
Mark of the Storm
Innate:
Kennen's
abilities apply a stack of
Mark of the Storm
to enemies hit.
The third stack consumes them all to briefly
stun
the target and restore
energy
. The duration is dramatically reduced if this occurs on the same target again within a few seconds.
League of Legends content
Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.
League of Legends content
Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
area damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many items effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 10% whenever you deal an instance of
area damage
, per target effected.
Area damage
is reduced by 25% versus
Counter Strike
.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Blind
A unit that is
blinded
will
miss
their
basic attacks
for the duration, comparable to attacking a target that is able to
dodge
or
block
, but not mechanically similar.
Missed
basic attacks will fail to deal damage and apply
on-hit
effects, with the exception of some
empowered basic attacks
.
Blind
does not prevent the unit from declaring attacks, unlike
Disarm
.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions, but will prevent
on-hit effects
from being triggered by basic attacks.
Reduction:
The
duration

Dodge
Dodging
an instance of damage will
skip
its damage event entirely, preventing it from being taken and effects that trigger from damage.
Dodge
takes precedence over
block
, but not
blind
.
Effects that
dodge
damage will only
dodge
instances that are
dodgeable

Basic attacks and abilities that apply on-hit effects are always
dodged

This effect is exclusive to
Jax's
Counter Strike

Block
Blocking
an instance of damage will reduce its value to
0

Effects that
block
damage will only
block
