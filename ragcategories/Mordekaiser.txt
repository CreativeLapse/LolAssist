Death Realm:
The
Death Realm
confines units in a small area. Allies and enemies cannot see or interact with those in the
Death Realm
but can see their locations and vice versa.
Active:
Mordekaiser
aims his mace towards the target enemy champion,
slowing
them by 75% and
revealing
them over the cast time, and then
banishing
them with him to the
Death Realm
for 7 seconds.

Death Realm
,
Mordekaiser
keeps their partial stats until they
respawn
.
Units between realms see each other as spirits, considering each other dead and negating any
interactions
between each other. Only
Mordekaiser
and the target will enter the realm; other champions cannot follow them. Everything that occurs inside the
Death Realm
is hidden to units outside of it, and vice versa. All
pets
still inside the realm are killed at its end.
If one of the two affected champions leave the Death Realm, because of having died or having it dispelled, the other will do so as well.
"Welcome to oblivion."

Mordekaiser's Realm of Death. Champions outside of the death realm are seen as spirits. Blue spirits (above Mordekaiser) are allied champions while red spirits (below Mordekaiser) are enemy champions.
Ally spirit
Enemy spirit
The
Realm of Death
is a battlefield that exists outside of the normal realm in an alternate "dimension". It exists only for
Mordekaiser
and his target. It consists of an arena that has a radius of 1200 units and includes any terrain features that would exist in the map of the normal realm, including walls and
brushes
.
The boundaries of the arena are impassable but not considered terrain themselves (
Unstoppable Onslaught
exception), and enemies that try to move out of the area will be displaced back inside.
Dashes
,
blinks
,
displacements
and other forms of movement will cap their effect range to the boundary. Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.
Realm of Death
retains
Mordekaiser's
previous
current
health percentage when granting him a portion of the target's
maximum
health.
Realm of Death
will cancel and go on cooldown after its cast time if:
The target is
displacement immune
,
crowd control immune
or protected by a
spell shield
.
Note that all of the above plus any
cleanse
effect are ineffective if they are applied
after
the target has been banished.
The target is a
clone
or
Sion's
Glory in Death
.
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but does not go on
cooldown
nor pay its cost (if applicable).
If
Mordekaiser
or the target cast another
Realm of Death
, the affected champions will remain stuck for the duration of the new circle.
The previous circle will be overridden by the new one; it will be dispelled to enter the new circle.
Spell shield
will not block the initial
slow
.
The reveal effect lasts for 1.
25
seconds from the start of the cast time if the cast does not complete. Otherwise, the reveal ends as soon as the cast time completes.
If the target's
health
is lower than the amount that should be stolen, they will be brought down to 1 health.
Mordekaiser
will still get the usual amount of maximum health.
Entering or leaving the
Death Realm
will cause all targeted
projectiles
to be
destroyed
.
The transition in and out of the
Death Realm
doesn't interrupt
channels
.
Grand Starfall
will always be interrupted by the transition into the realm.
Realm of Death
will not be dispelled if either of the two affected champions enter
resurrection
after taking lethal damage. It is dispelled if the target enters a
zombie state
.
Any active
tether
effects (both friendly and hostile ones) existing on either of the two champions entering the realm will be broken (unless the tether is between those two).
Upon entering the realm,
Mordekaiser
and the target are
cleansed
from all
forced action
effects
The cleanse will occur even if the source enters the realm.
(bug)
Unlike the other stats,
Mordekaiser
does not
steal
enemy total size; instead he gains 10% of his own size and reduces the enemy's size by 10% of theirs (all size modifiers stack additively).
Mordekaiser
grows in size over 0.
25
seconds after successfully stealing his targets' stats, and shrinks over 0.
25
seconds after the buff runs out again. The target shrinks over 0.
25
seconds after their stats are stolen, but grows back to normal size instantly when the effect ends.
While
Mordekaiser
has hold of his enemy's stats, that champion's circular portrait will appear as a pip next to his health bar, visible to all players.
Realm of Death's
interactions with other elements/abilities (
list is incomplete
):
Multiple
Death Realms
(possible through a
hijacked
Realm of Death
or if multiple
Mordekaisers
are in the same match) spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.
Tahm Kench's
Devour
can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once
Regurgitated
.
An active
Cease and Desist
on a target outside the perimeter will cause
Vi
to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knock back and damage secondary targets multiple times.
Structures
exist in all realms at the same time.
Turrets
will behave normally as if all units were in the same realm.
Hex-gates
on
Hextech Rift
will not be present between realms.
Brushes
will maintain their presence between realms.
Switching realms detaches all
attached
champions on either of the two champions entering the realm.
Kayn's
Umbral Trespass
will cause him to detach immediately when
Realm of Death
ends.
The allied health, resource, and ultimate indicators (champion portraits located on the screen) will not update between realms as the
players
have no
vision
of them.

Tips & Tricks
While in lane,
Realm of Death
is best used while the target is between you and your turret. This is so the target doesn't have much space to go towards their turret, since the area of the
Death Realm
is created in front of
Mordekaiser
, leaving little space to move behind him.

Twice slain and thrice born, Mordekaiser is a brutal warlord from a foregone epoch who uses his necromantic sorcery to bind souls into an eternity of servitude. Few now remain who remember his earlier conquests, or know the true extent of his powers-- but there are some ancient souls that do, and they fear the day when he may return to claim dominion over both the living and the dead.

Once a member of the Cosmic Court, Mordekaiser vanished from known space for an epoch—until now. Reborn and returned from an unknown destruction, Mordekaiser seems bent on unmaking the kingdoms of stars and light he once built. Though he still bears his Cosmic armor, the mind and figure within has been twisted and reforged to know only hatred and destruction.

Perhaps Mordekaiser believed his powers would be spared, or perhaps the old knight planned to betray his fellows and reign over their darkened kingdoms. It matters little now, as he awaits the end of death itself.

Once known as the Horned King, Old God Mordekaiser turned that which was once dead to his cause, using their shambling forms to topple kingdoms and claim their lands as his own. Before he was slain by the Eclipse Knights, he swore that when he returned to this world, they would all bend to his will and take to the frontlines of his undead army.

cannot
leave.
Units between realms see each other as spirits, considering each other dead and negating any interactions between the two. Only the target and

will enter the realm, other champions cannot follow them. Everything that occurs inside the
Death Realm
is hidden, and all non-champion pets still inside are destroyed at the end.

Trivia

]
Mordekaiser, the Master of Metal
Mordekaiser might have been inspired by the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
, particularly Conquest.
Mordekaiser was the only champion without any mobility or crowd control effects until
V5.4
onwards where
Creeping Death
was changed to give him situational bonus movement speed.
Mordekaiser might have been responsible for around 80% of all live bugs in League of Legends.

Children of the Grave
used to apply the longest damage-over-time effect in the game (10 seconds).

Shield
A
shield
adds hitpoints over the unit's
health
that absorbs the next instances of
damage
in place of actual health. This can be improved by various
items
and effects depending on the type of
shielding
.
Incoming
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Shield Bash
. Outgoing
shields
can trigger bonus effects from
Summon Aery
,
Ardent Censer
, and
Staff of Flowing Water
. Shield reduction effects, exclusively
Serpent's Fang
, reduce all incoming and outgoing
shields
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.
League of Legends content
Champion
Champions
are the player-controlled characters in
League of Legends
. Each champion possesses unique abilities and
attributes

Monster
Monsters
are neutral units in
League of Legends
. Unlike
minions
, monsters do not fight for either team, and will only do so if provoked (with the exception of the
Rift Scuttler
, which simply runs away when attacked).
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
League of Legends content
Persistent area damage
Persistent area damage
is technically not a separate type of damage, but rather a hybrid classification that is applied to some spells.
In situations where
persistent damage
and
area damage
would have conflicting outputs, the conflict is resolved by choosing the weakest possible outcome.
Physical vamp
and
Spell vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness, as with
area damage
.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 5%, as with
persistent damage
, per target affected.
Counter Strike
reduces the damage dealt by 25%, as with
area damage
.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Airborne
A unit that is knocked
airborne
undergoes a
forced displacement
in a specified direction, to a specific point, or for a set duration at its current location, during which it is also unable to control its movement, declare attacks, cast abilities, activate items or use the
summoner spells
Flash

displacements
, including
dashes
and other
airborne
effects.
Reduction:
The
duration
of
airborne

forced movement
execution time is unaffected by
Tenacity

Removal:
The forced movement that is applied alongside

reduced
in duration,
resisted
, nor
removed
unless special cased to do so.
The crowd control effect may still be
cleansed
if it is applied as a
debuff
separate from the originated ability.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Sion
becomes
Cc-immune
and
charges
forward for a period, gradually gaining

movement speed
and dealing
physical damage
to enemies hit based on the charge time.

Dash
A
dash
is a quick movement action by a unit in which they move to a specific direction or location while traversing the intervening distance, ignoring the boundaries of terrain.
The game engine does not take into account the height of the unit; dashes that depict air travel are considered to be on the ground for targeting purposes such as
skill-shots
.
Dashes should not be confused with
displacement
effects, which are usually sourced from enemy units (and are classified as
crowd control
debuffs).
Dashes are interrupted by
stasis
(from an enemy),
knockdown
, and
blinks
.
Dashes are overridden by all move blocks, which includes
displacements
and other dashes, as well as a few other cases.
Not all dashes can traverse terrain (e.g.
Justice Punch
,
Searing Charge
,
Tumble
).
Some dashes gain increased distance when directed through terrain (e.g.
Umbral Dash
,
Perfect Execution
,
Phantom Undertow
).

Blink

blink
refers to a form of movement whereby a unit displaces from point A to B without traversing the space between.

any
type of
crowd control
from being
applied
to the unit. CC which has already been applied will still have an effect on the unit. Epic

(excluding a summoned
Rift Herald

all
crowd control effects, some sources would specify only one or a few types of crowd control.

clone
or
decoy
is a specific type of
pet

player
champions, else they are considered
minions
either small or large among certain cases.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
