The mark fully forming signifies the 2.
5
seconds have elapsed, meaning the
charm
will be applied on the triggering attack or ability.
An enemy champion cursed by
Allure
is alarmed of her presence and after the mark has fully formed, an arrow will appear next to them pointing towards
Evelynn's
direction. This is visible to both teams.
The
magic penetration
will be applied to the attack or ability that triggers it.
Allure's
mark application on a target cannot be blocked by
spell shield
.
The expunge will not occur if the ability is blocked by a spell shield. The mark does not trigger and will remain on the target in this case.
The
magic resistance reduction
debuff is applied independently of the
Charm
debuff when the matured mark is expunged, meaning a target can still have their magic resistance reduced while they are resisting applications of CC debuffs (e.g.
Morgana's
Black Shield
).
If the target becomes
untargetable
,
dies
, or is too far away or no longer in
sight
during the cast time, this ability will cancel but still go on
cooldown
and pay its cost.
(bug)
Allure
will restart its cooldown whenever the mark debuff is removed.

Within the dark seams of Runeterra, the demon Evelynn searches for her next victim. She lures in prey with the voluptuous façade of a human female, but once a person succumbs to her charms, Evelynn’s true form is unleashed. She then subjects her victim to unspeakable torment, gratifying herself with their pain. To the demon, these liaisons are innocent flings. To the rest of Runeterra, they are ghoulish tales of lust gone awry and horrific reminders of the cost of wanton desire.

What is fashion if not a wild new frontier? If there's anyone who knows how to take style by the reins and ride it into the sunset, it's this rodeo queen.

Assassin
Slayers
(formerly "Assassins") are fragile but agile damage-focused melee champions that look to swiftly take down their targets.
Assassins
specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets. Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute their targets. Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively avoid incoming damage.

Jungle
Within a
drafted team
, the
Jungler
is the champion assigned to the jungle. A
Jungler
needs to be able to
clear jungle camps
without too much difficulty and ambush other champions in lane.
Divers
,
Assassins
,
Skirmishers
, and
Vanguards
are the most likely champions to be selected in the
Jungler
position.

Mana
Mana
(also known as
MP
) is a
stat
that is the resource of many
champions
necessary to cast most of their
abilities
. Mana can be restored via
mana regeneration
and some
abilities
,
items
,
runes
, and
buffs
.
Mana
is represented in-game by the blue bar within the HUD, indicating the champion's
current
mana and
maximum
mana.
Current
mana is reduced by expenditure through paying an ability's mana
cost
.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range
by the same amount.

Camouflage
Camouflage
is a form of stealth that renders a unit hidden from enemy
vision
for a
long
period of time. It is usually activated preemptively in order to ambush an enemy or to bypass the surveillance of hostile
wards
patrolling an area. It also grants
ghosting
.
Camouflaged
units are revealed while being inside the line of sight (e.g. not in the fog of war, behind terrain, or blocked by
nearsight
) of a nearby enemy
champion
(with the range depending on the ability), when within the vision radius of an enemy
Control Ward
(900 units), or from sources of
True Sight
.
Stealthed
units shimmer their character model for 0.
6
seconds whenever they take damage.
A unit will shimmer for every instance of damage they take, and shimmering does not make the unit targetable nor remove the
stealth
effect, but grants positional information to the enemy.
When a
camouflaged
unit can be seen, they will be warned by an exclamation mark above them indicating they have been spotted.
League of Legends content
Break stealth
Breaking stealth
involves the event of immediately ending the effects of
camouflage
and
invisibility
through actions. By default, all stealth buffs will end prematurely if the user performs a basic attack or casts an ability unless stated otherwise. Summoner spells and item actives vary in whether or not they break stealth.
The following item actives and summoner spells will break stealth upon use:
Black Spear
Hextech Rocketbelt
Profane Hydra
Randuin's Omen
Ravenous Hydra
Redemption
Stridebreaker
Tiamat
Titanic Hydra

Turret
A
turret
, also called a
tower
, is a fortification that defends a part of territory. It provides vision of the area and autonomously fires homing bolts at nearby enemies, establishing a defensive ground for allies.
Turrets are most notable in
Classic
, defending against waves of enemy
Minions
from their ultimate goal of destroying the nexus. Champions work to destroy enemy turrets to push their assault into the enemies' territory. Turrets visually fall apart as they take damage.

Sight
Sight
is a property of
units
,
structures
, certain
summoner spells
,
items
, and
abilities
that represents a team possessing vision of a target area or unit. It is always
center range
. A line of vision cannot extend beyond terrain or an unrevealed brush.
Sight
can also refer to an effect that makes a unit visible regardless of the fog of war or
brush
, allowing them to be targeted.
Standard sight
cannot see
stealthed
units, but
True Sight
can.
Nearsight
is a
crowd control
debuff that inhibits
sight
; allied vision is lost in addition to a reduced sight radius.
Obscured vision
is similar to
sight
in a way that it can observe units, but does not render units
targetable
, rather it exposes their position and informs of their presence.
Unobstructed vision
is a form of
sight
that allows a unit to be able to see their full vision radius, ignoring any obstructions that would otherwise restrict visibility.
All effects that use
unit-targeting
require
sight
of the target. Delayed
unit-targeted
attacks and spells can cancel if
sight
of the selected target is suddenly lost.

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.
Arcane Comet's
cooldown is reduced by 20% per instance of
spell damage
you deal.
Effects triggered by damage sub-types will occur (e.g.
Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage
and
Morellonomicon
on instances of
Magic damage
).

Area damage
Area damage
is the damage type dealt by most area of effect abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of

area damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heals with one-third effectiveness.

The Black Cleaver
on instances of
Physical damage

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

Untargetable
A unit that is
untargetable
is an invalid target and cannot be hit. Effects that have already been applied from being hit will not be invalidated, unless they require targetability.
Becoming untargetable will cause targeted inputs to be interrupted and non-champions to lose aggro. Most untargetabilities will also
destroy
all incoming targeted
projectiles
.

Death
Death
occurs when a unit's
health
is reduced to zero, thereby being killed. The unit can no longer act and is removed or becomes a corpse.
On player death, they can view the
death recap
and the
shop
to purchase items, and some
item actives
can be used while dead.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.
League of Legends content
On-hit effect
On-hit
is an umbrella term for a type of effect that triggers on instances of
basic damage
, or generally upon a
basic attack
or certain attack-like
ability
hitting a target. Most on-hit effects deal
proc damage
or
default damage
, which are non-reactive (= the effects don't trigger more effects).
Critical strikes
are
not
on-hit effects. An ability listed as applying on-hit effects cannot critically strike unless otherwise stated.
Life steal
is
not
an on-hit effect. Damage from on-hit effects normally does not apply life steal, unless those effects deal
basic damage
or are special-cased to benefit from life steal.
The ability counterpart to
on-hit effects
are
ability effects
, which apply on instances of
ability damage
.
