Dr. Mundo
pays a

Dr. Mundo
can move near the canister to consume it,

will also grant
Dr. Mundo
immunity to additional immobilizing effects from the same
cast instance
.
Abilities where non-immobilizing effects and damage are nested into immobilizing ones will have them also prevented. Non-immobilizing effects and damage applied separately (the vast majority of cases) are not prevented.

Utterly insane, unrepentantly homicidal, and horrifyingly purple, Dr. Mundo is what keeps many of Zaun’s citizens indoors on particularly dark nights. This monosyllabic monstrosity seems to want nothing more than pain—both the giving of it, and the receiving of it. Wielding his massive meat cleaver as if it were weightless, Mundo is infamous for capturing and torturing dozens of Zaun’s citizens for his nefarious 'operations,' which seem to have no overall point or goal. He is brutal. He is unpredictable. He goes where he pleases. He is also not, technically, a doctor.

There are many tales of the Rageborn menace: that he's slain dragons with a single cleave, that the mightiest wizards cannot halt his advances, that no noble knight foolish enough to try and stop him has ever come back alive. The accounts often contradict each other, but the one thing they all agree on is this: Where Mundo goes, no one else pleases.

Trivia
[

]
Dr. Mundo, the Madman of Zaun
"Mundo" has two real world origins: the Proto-Germanic
*mundo
"hand, protection" & unrelated Ibero-
Romance
mundo
"world" (like in Spanish, Portuguese, etc.).
He is named after
Edmundo 'odnumde' Sanchez
, by
Brandon 'Ryze' Beck
.
[2]
Dr. Mundo's dance references the titular character from
House, M.D.
in turn dancing to
Fight the Power
by
Public Enemy
.
A side-by-side comparison be seen
here
.
In the
V1.0.0.115
April Fools' Day
patch, the following change regarding Dr. Mundo were jokingly listed：
Dr. Mundo decided that he enjoys the color blue.
Dr. Mundo now has mana.
None of his ability costs have changed.
Masochism
references the
eponymous term
for enjoyment derived from being inflicted pain, named after real-life writer
Leopold von Sacher-Masoch
.
This is also mechanically referenced in his kit by gaining a higher AD bonus the lower his health is.
The ability's name also fits for the
early iterations
of his E ability, which caused Dr. Mundo to be healed instead of being damaged from physical attacks for a duration.
Sadism
references the
eponymous term
for enjoyment derived from inflicting pain on others, named after real-life writer
Marquis de Sade
.
The name chosen for this ability made the most sense for the
early iterations
of his R ability, which damaged nearby enemies for their current health.
Dr. Mundo, the Madman of Zaun
Dr. Mundo
is one of 21 champions without a single
ability power
ratio on any ability:
Aatrox
,
Camille

,
Samira
,
Sett
,
Talon
,
Urgot
,
Xayah
,
Yone
, and
Zed
.
Dr. Mundo is one of six champions who use health as a resource for abilities, the other five being
Briar
,
Olaf
,
Soraka
,
Vladimir
and
Zac
.
His dance is a
Pec Flex
which involves flexing his pectoral muscles.
His
death
animation shows him assume the morgue pose whilst adding a toe tag to himself.
Goes Where He Pleases
is among a few abilities that were named after a quote of their champion. In this case, it references his "Mundo goes where he pleases" quote which he had before the patch he got the ability,
V11.12
.
The others are
Draven's
League of Draven
and
Graves'
End of the Line
.
Following his rework, his kit was given a higher emphasis on medical equipment and terms, thus making several references to them.
Infected Bonesaw
was renamed from
Infected Cleaver
to have Dr. Mundo utilize the
actual medical tool
.
Heart Zapper
is based on the act of
defibrillation
.
Blunt Force Trauma
references the term for the
eponymous injury type
.

Juggernauts
are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those foolish enough to get within their grasp. They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn they have a tough time closing in on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility.

Health
Some champions use
Health
as a resource to cast abilities.
While these champions can cast their abilities more freely than most, their disadvantage is that frequent ability usage will bring them closer to taking
fatal damage
.
Health costs
ignore
invulnerability
as well as effects that
prevent
falling below a certain health value.
League of Legends content
Melee
Melee
champions have a basic attack
range
usually within 200 units. A melee attack does not use a projectile to deal damage, therefore not subject to effects that mitigate projectiles, like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for melee characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.
League of Legends content
Selection radius
A unit's
selection radius
is how close the mouse cursor has to be to the center of their model in order to click on them.
League of Legends content
Pathing radius
A unit's
pathing radius
is the size of their model for unit-collision and pathfinding logic. A unit's center cannot intersect with another unit's pathing radius, except if they are
ghosted
.
League of Legends content
Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.
Auto-attacking
automatically
orders an idle champion to acquire enemies within this range. This can be disabled in the
game settings
.
Attack-move commands scan for targets within this range while moving toward a given location.
Attack range
bonuses modify the champion's
acquisition range

Centered range
Centered range
is calculated from the
center
of a source unit's hitbox to the
center
of a target unit's hitbox.
Centered range is used for most
unit-targeted
abilities.
It is
less
effective and may seem to have diminished reach against
large
units.
League of Legends content
Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Slow
A unit that is
slowed
has reduced
movement speed
for the duration.
Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below
110 movement speed
. Some
slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.
Interrupts:
Does not interrupt any actions.

The
duration

Spell damage
Spell damage
is the damage type dealt by most single target abilities, as well as a select few basic attacks, items and runes. Most sources of
spell damage
have the
magic damage
sub-type, but this is not guaranteed.
Many effects are triggered whenever you deal an instance of
spell damage
. For example:
Rylai's Crystal Scepter
,
Liandry's Torment
and
Luden's Companion
.
Omnivamp
and
Physical vamp
(where applicable) heal for a percentage of damage dealt.

Persistent area damage

Uncancellable windup
Some effects cause a basic attack to have an
uncancellable windup
. Unlike normal basic attacks and similar to the cast time of a spell, the windup of these attacks cannot be
interrupted
by neither the user themselves nor any status effect, other than
death
,
polymorph
and
Quinn's
Vault
, and sometimes
untargetability
and range.
Any effect that would disrupt an attack's windup, aside from the ones noted above, are ignored by basic attacks with
uncancellable windups
. If the attack doesn't lock out other abilities, they may be used normally, and the basic attack will hit during the ability cast.

Basic attack reset
An
attack reset
is a mechanic that will result in a champion's attack timer being reset to zero. When this effect takes place during the basic attack's cooldown and not its windup, it allows the attacker to start a second attack quicker than normal.
Casting certain ability and item actives can reset the attack timer.
Hail of Blades

stack
from successful
attack resets
