Xerath is an Ascended Magus of ancient Shurima, a being of arcane energy writhing in the broken shards of a magical sarcophagus. For millennia, he was trapped beneath the desert sands, but the rise of Shurima freed him from his ancient prison. Driven insane with power, he now seeks to take what he believes is rightfully his and replace the upstart civilizations of the world with one fashioned in his image.

The question of the human soul has always intrigued Viktor, and so he set to work building a Battlecast machine capable of harnessing it. The resulting Xerath units are twisted, hellish monsters imprisoned in a cage of psychic energy, constantly discharging superheated plasma toward any opponent in range.

As the Dark Star continued on its path across space, it passed through a vibrant system orbiting a supergiant star. Consuming all life and light as it passed , the Dark Star twisted the supergiant into a wrathful corruptant. Thus, Xerath was born—a dark being of malice and annihilation.

Ensnared by his own desires, Xerath leads citizens of Low Arcana to act on their basest urges. The more they are entranced by the forbidden, the more his power grows. But while Xerath believes their temptation will lead to his deliverance, he does not realize that the stronger he becomes, the more tightly his chains bind him.

An obsessive chemist driven by power, Xerath discovered the invader meeps and devoted his life to researching how to harness their energy. After an explosion during one of his experiments, his body was permanently mutated. Now, fully consumed by the corrupted meeps, Xerath traverses the galaxy, seeking to spread his malice across the cosmos.

Once a humble fisherman, Xerath returned from a voyage with a multitude of magical crystals in tow. Their power elevated him to become a leader of his people, ushering in what he hoped would be a new era of the Prismae Crystals' rule. But the cost of such power damaged his mind, leaving him suspicious that no thoughts are to be trusted… even his own.

Trivia
[

]
When Xerath
dies
, his body quickly becomes unstable and overly shiny, just to blow up a moment later, much like a nuclear-powered machine.
The icon for Xerath's ability,
Arcanopulse
is slightly similar to that of the Season 3 mastery
Blast
.
Xerath's dance is a reference "industrial dancing", which is evident in the song
Pong by Eisenfunk
.
A side-by-side comparison can be seen
here
.
Xerath himself can be seen when he performs his taunt. As he disarms the parts of his sarcophagus, a person made of pure energy or electricity can be briefly seen.
When he dies this "person" disappears, what remains on the ground are the shattered remains of his sarcophagus.
It's likely that that form was his actual look before he got locked away.
Some speculate that Xerath is ambidextrous as he uses both left and right hands for different attacks and abilities, unlike most champions who almost always use their dominant hand (usually their right one).
Xerath,
Blitzcrank
,
Caitlyn
,
Lissandra
,
Rumble
,
Sion
,
Varus
,
Vi
,
Viego
, and
Ziggs
are the only champions who can apply
crowd control
on themselves.
Xerath's ethereal form imprisoned in a human-shapen sarcophagus also resembles
Battle Realms
'
Master Warlock
, consisting of an ethereal warlock inside another warlock's skeletal remains.
Xerath features as the
Ancient Ascendant
in the
Ascension
featured game mode

Artillery
Mages
are offensive casters that seek to cripple and burn down the opposition through their potent spells.
Artillery Mages
are the masters of range, and they leverage that advantage to whittle down their opponents over time from great distances. In turn, Artillery Mages are severely punished when enemies finally succeed in closing in on them, due to their extreme fragility and limited mobility.

Support (Legacy)
Support
refers to a broad roster of champions who support their allies. As this description is better suited to the champion's role within a drafted team, individual supports can vary wildly from champions that can create opportunities for their allies by disrupting the enemy, defensive casters whose abilities empower their allies and more durable champions that hold their team's front line.

League of Legends content
Support
Within a
drafted team
, the
Support
is one of the two champions assigned to the bottom lane alongside the
Bottom Carry
. This role's initial goal is to assist their more vulnerable team mate through the earliest stages of the game, and is a position that suits champions with either utility, disengage or high base damage.
Within a duo lane, the optimal strategy for earning gold is to designate a single champion to
farm
while the other is recommended to purchase an
economy item
. The
Support
is expected to fulfill the latter designation: consequently, the position is not suitable for champions that are highly dependent on item-based power spikes. The
Support
is also expected to be the primary contributor to the team's
vision

Mana
Mana
(also known as

mana regeneration

Ranged
Ranged
champions have a basic attack
range
usually beyond 300 units. Many deal damage through projectiles, which are subject to mitigating effects like
Wind Wall
. Some champions can shift between a ranged and melee form, and certain items/runes differ for ranged characters.
League of Legends content
Attack windup
The
attack windup
is a portion of the
basic attack
animation that must play out in order to launch it. For
projectile
basic attacks, the windup usually aligns with drawing the projectile on-screen.
The attack windup is displayed as a percentage, and any windup modifier is listed as a decimal next to it.
League of Legends content
Attack speed ratio
The
Attack speed ratio (AS ratio)
adjusts the effectiveness of bonus AS from all sources. It is usually equal to the unit's base AS (level 1 with no bonuses), but tuning to a higher or lower relative value translates to more or less bonus AS received compared to other units with the same base AS.
Total AS = Base AS + Bonus AS ×
AS Ratio
(All values in decimal form)
The ingame stats HUD displays the
AS ratio
instead of base AS to communicate this comparative effectiveness. The Wiki opts to always list both stats and show the
AS ratio
as "N/A" if the two are equal.
League of Legends content
Gameplay radius
A unit's
gameplay radius
is a value that most closely resembles the concept of a 'hitbox', and is the radius used for
edge range
effects (e.g.
basic attacks
,
line collision missiles
and rectangular AOEs). This radius applies to both incoming and outgoing effects - i.e. your
basic attack range
is added on to your gameplay radius, and you are within the attack range of enemies based on the edge of your gameplay radius.

A unit's
selection radius

Acquisition radius
A unit's
acquisition range
is the distance at which they will acquire attack targets when a target unit is not specified by the player.

Edge range
Edge range
is calculated from the
edge
of a source unit's hitbox to the
edge
of a target unit's hitbox.
Edge range is mostly used for
basic attacks
;
skill shots
; and point-blank areas of effect (including
auras
).
It is
more
effective against large champions, as the source gains more reach against them. This may be favorable or unfavorable: durable champions tend to be larger and thus easier to hit, and frail champions tend to be smaller and more difficult to hit.

Channel
A
channeled ability
is an ability that can be prevented from reaching its conclusion, by the user themself and / or because of other effects.
A
charged
ability has a channel that is toggled by two activations - the first begins the charging and the second will fire the ability. While using
quick cast
, the player must keep the hotkey held down to charge the ability and release to fire. Unlike normal channels, the caster is still able to move freely and cast movement abilities, unless otherwise stated.
A
movement channel
is a type of channel which also involves the caster moving from their position, usually in the form of traversal such as
dashes
and
blinks
. This means the crowd control effects
ground
and
root
, which both inhibit the activation of movement spells, can interrupt the channel.

Slow
percentages cannot reduce a target below

slows
will instead modify the target's
movement speed
to a static value, which may not be further reduced nor increased.
Only the slow with the highest value is taken into movement speed calculations. All additional slows are ignored until the higher-valued slow wears off. The strength of slows may amplify or decay over their duration. Slows of the same debuff cannot stack and will instead refresh on each application unless otherwise stated.

Obscured vision
An
obscured
target only has their position revealed to the enemy—such as through a silhouette or movement pattern as a visual effect—but their unit remains an un-rendered target for selection (i.e. they cannot be selected for
unit-targeted
attacks, draw
monster
aggro). The revealed silhouettes' color is different among
champions
, wards, and all other non-champion units (default:
red
,
blue
, and
purple
; respectively).
This is distinct from being
untargetable
, as an
obscured unit
is still vulnerable to
auras
,
direction-targeted
and
ground-targeted
effects, and
auto-targeted
effects that do not require
sight
of targets.
Obscured vision
is not concealed by
nearsight
